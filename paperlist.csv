2006papers/paper14.5.pdf,IEEE 1588: AN UPDATE ON THE STANDARD AND ITS APPLICATION John C. Eidson Agilent Technologies Inc. 5301 Stevens Creek Boulevard MS 54U-SM Santa Clara CA 95051-7201 USA E-mail: john_eidson@agilent.com Abstract,Since the publication of version 1 of IEEE 1588 in November 2002 there has been increasing interest in and development of the technology. The standard has been adopted by a number of trade groups and is referenced in several other standards. The 1588 standard is currently being revised to include provisions for new application areas and to improve the quality of synchronization. This paper will present the technical issues under discussion in the P1588 standards group and outline the proposed changes to the standard. The applications and technology requirements driving these changes will be discussed. A brief review of application areas supporting products available and demonstrated synchronization performance will be provided. The paper will conclude with a brief discussion of how IEEE 1588 is changing electronic measurement instrumentation and how this will change the architecture of measurement systems. I. WHAT IS IEEE 1588? IEEE 1588 Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for Networked Measurement and Control Systems is a protocol often called PTP used to synchronize real-time clocks in modules of a networked distributed system. The protocol was designed specifically to aid in the coordination of activities and the correlation of data in distributed systems typically found in test and measurement industrial automation and similar environments. Implementations are easily capable of synchronization,2006

Richard Beckman USAF Tom Celano Symmetricom Mikel Miller and Peter Howe U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory Abstract Two-way time transfer (TWTT) has proven itself as an accurate and reliable,method for synchronization over large static baselines. While previous demonstrations have shown the merit of extending TWTT to dynamic platforms the technology has always been dogged by the fact that it requires specialized equipment and post-processing of the data. If TWTT is to establish itself as a viable means of synchronization between dynamic platforms it must first demonstrate the ability to operate in real-time with COTS hardware. The most recent airborne test set out to demonstrate this capability and the results of that test are presented herein. 1.0,2006

2006papers/paper6.pdf,MINIATURIZED MERCURY ION CLOCK FOR ULTRA-STABLE DEEP SPACE APPLICATIONS John D. Prestage Sang Chung Lawrence Lim and Thanh Le Jet Propulsion Lab California Institute of Technology Pasadena CA 91109-8099 USA E-mail: John.D.Prestage@jpl.nasa.gov Abstract We have recently completed a prototype ion-clock physics package based on Hg ions,shuttled between a quadrupole and a 16-pole rf trap. With this architecture we have demonstrated short-term stability ~2-3x10 -13 at 1 second averaging to 10 -15 at 1 day. This development shows that H-maser quality stabilities can be produced in a small clock package comparable in size to an ultra-stable quartz oscillator required for holding 1-2x 10 -13 at 1 second. This performance was obtained in a sealed vacuum configuration where only a getter pump was used to maintain vacuum. The vacuum tube containing the traps has now been under sealed vacuum conditions for nearly 1.5 years with no measurable degradation of ion trapping lifetimes or clock short-term performance. Because the tube is sealed the Hg source and Neon buffer gas are held indefinitely for the life of the tube. There is no consumption of Hg in this system unlike in a Cs beam tube where the lifetime is often limited by Cs depletion. This approach to the vacuum follows the methods used in flight vacuum tube electronics such as flight TWTA’s where tube operation lifetime and shelf life of up to 15 years is achieved. We use neon as a buffer gas with 2-3 times less pressure induced frequency pulling than traditional helium and being heavier negligible diffusion losses will occur over the,2006

2006papers/paper13.pdf,USNO MASTER CLOCK DESIGN ENHANCEMENTS P. Koppang J. Skinner and D. Johns U.S. Naval Observatory Abstract We have implemented several enhancements to the US Naval Observatory (USNO) Master Clock system. Design changes to the system include the use of a Kalman filter for phase and frequency estimates decreasing the time interval between steers and the redesign of control parameters. The present control system utilizes “real-time” data estimates of the differences between the Master Clock and a timescale that combines hydrogen masers and commercial,cesium frequency standards with a time-varying weighting scheme. We are researching a Master Clock system design that utilizes as its reference a hydrogen maser ensemble that is steered to an ensemble of cesium standards. We present system designs simulations and performance data.,2006
2006papers/paper17.pdf,APPLICATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE IEEE 1588 STANDARD IN MILITARY APPLICATIONS John D. MacKay Progeny Systems Inc. Abstract Many government/military data acquisition and signal processing systems are being migrated away from full mil-qualified components in favor of systems that maximize the use of,commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Field and ship-board systems provide environmentally conditioned “hotel” space for these components which are then chosen for performance low cost and common use in the commercial world. The use of COTS has its drawbacks however. Both in the front-end data acquisition and in the devices that bridge the COTS systems to the legacy components that still remain data and interface synchronization becomes difficult since many COTS devices replace legacy equipment that has hard-wired deterministic hardware. IEEE 1588 (Precision Time Protocol) provides both a viable solution to this dilemma and opportunities to maximize the full performance capabilities of the COTS system. It is a network time protocol that can afford the system a universal notion of time in a network-based architecture as well as across the legacy boundary. This paper discusses a number of potential use cases for IEEE 1588 addressing the need for a COTS-equivalent deterministic clock source a common system and intra-system time reference and potential opportunities for future systems. THE ROLE OF IEEE 1588 IN MILITARY SYSTEMS The transition in the past 10 years for many military-technology-based systems from a full mil-qualified development process to a COTS-based one has been largely successful. This model in fact is reflected in other industries such as industrial automation and telecommunications. In all these application areas the rapid advancement of consumer- and commercial-based technology has been utilized for the development of systems that in turn rapidly advanced the technology base of the technology systems,2006

2006papers/paper28.pdf,UNBIASED FIR ESTIMATES VS. THE SAWTOOTH- CORRECTED GPS-BASED MEASUREMENTS : EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION Y. S. Shmaliy L. Arceo-Miquel J. Munoz-Diaz and O. Ibarra-Manzano Guanajuato University FIMEE Mexico E-mail: shmaliy@salamanca.ugto.mx Abstract We show that owing to small noise and smoothed excursions the unbiased FIR filtering algorithm produces more accurate estimates of the TIE model of a local clock than the,sawtooth-less GPS-based measurements. The algorithm becomes much more efficient in estimating the fractional frequency offset and higher order states. For the algorithm to work with minimum errors the optimal time step τ opt and number of the points in the average N opt must be ascertained in the sense of the minimum mean-square error (MSE) for each of the clock states. The relevant dependencies of N opt on τ opt are found experimentally for a crystal clock. The trade-off between the estimates and sawtooth-less measurements is illustrated graphically.,2006

In 2006 we have started to phase in the hardware for a new system still under development which should allow us to define UTC (CH) as a real time scale generated by a master clock i.e. a time scale defined for all epochs. The new system should preserve the advantages of the original system while improving reliability availability and compatibility with other UTC (k)’s.,2006

2006papers/paper29.pdf,AN ENSEMBLE OF ULTRA-STABLE QUARTZ OSCILLATORS TO IMPROVE SPACECRAFT ONBOARD FREQUENCY STABILITY Mihran Miranian Gregory L. Weaver and Matthew J. Reinhart JHU/Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD 20723-6099 USA E-mail: gregory.weaver@jhuapl.edu Abstract In the past years we have reported on continuous improvement in the capability of our Time and Frequency Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and its,contribution to the TAI. We have discussed our ensemble of hydrogen maser and cesium beam atomic clocks into a timescale that enables UTC (APL) to be steered within ± 20 nanoseconds per month of UTC. A significant element to the control of UTC (APL) has been the use of our autonomous timescale algorithm reported in 2005 at the combined PTTI and IEEE FCS. In our laboratory report this year we will discuss experimentation using this timescale algorithm to investigate the timekeeping capability of an ensemble of three quartz ultra-stable oscillators (USO). This experimental ensemble could represent the frequency references of a system of spacecraft similar to those proposed in deep space missions of long duration. Although these spacecraft would likely be in regular communication with the ground segment controllers it may be necessary that they operate autonomously for periods of time ranging from a few days to several weeks. To make this possible we are considering improvement in the frequency stability of the onboard timing reference that will act as a fly-wheel when frequency corrections from mission controllers have been temporarily interrupted. We present experimental data and examine the compliance of the ensemble of three USOs to a frequency stability of better than ±1x 10 -11 per week. I. MOTIVATION FOR EXPERIMENT With expanding interest in both human and robotic exploration of the Moon Mars and other deep space destinations there is a need for reliable and accurate timekeeping and navigation at those locations.,2006

2006papers/paper30.pdf,ANALYSIS OF CLOCK MODELING TECHNIQUES FOR USNO CESIUM MEAN J. Skinner and P. Koppang U.S. Naval Observatory Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) maintains an ensemble of commercial cesium frequency standards. The mean timescale generated from this ensemble is used as the long- term frequency reference for all USNO clocks. Maintenance of this mean is currently done in a post-processing fashion with clock models being adjusted as far as 75 days into the past. While,this method ensures the resulting mean is stable in the past it can create errors in the near- real-time determination of the frequency of the mean. This in turn adds to the uncertainty in the determination of the clock frequencies relative to the mean. Multiple methods for adjusting clock models in near real time are examined and tested on actual clock data.,2006

2006papers/paper32.pdf,TIME DILATION AND THE LENGTH OF THE SECOND Steven D. Deines Carol A. Williams SiRF Technology Holdings Inc. Department of Mathematics and Statistics Cedar Rapids IA 52411 USA University of South Florida Tampa FL 33620 USA Abstract,We show that the leap second is due to timescale divergence between Universal Time (UT) and International Atomic Time (TAI) because the Système Internationale (SI) second is shorter than the UT second. This is demonstrated by a thorough analysis of the procedures that were followed to produce Ephemeris Time (ET) to which the SI second was calibrated. This paper shows that time dilation is responsible for the ET second being shorter than the UT second. Over the past century it was well documented that observed lunar and planetary positions always lagged behind calculated positions. ET was introduced to remove this discrepancy. Deceleration of Earth’s rotation contributed less than 1% of this timescale divergence according to paleontological records of tidal fraction. Our calculation of the time dilation effect match the difference between the SI and UT seconds and also match the leap second insertion rate to within 0.2% since atomic time began in 1958. A method to convert from the TAI timescale using a scalar to obtain a precise UT timescale is given with leap seconds needed only once every 14 decades due to tidal friction. Very little has been done to determine the effects of time dilation on old theories of celestial mechanics. Since these theories were developed before Einstein published his theory of General Relativity none of them consider the effects of time dilation. The question has some historical interest but it also may have implications for contemporary work. The theories considered in this paper are Simon Newcomb’s [1] theory of the Sun (equivalently Earth) and E. W. Brown’s [2],2006

2006papers/paper8.pdf,COMPARING TWO TYPES OF VHF LOW-NOISE FREQUENCY SOURCES FOR MICROWAVE AND HIGHER FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS Takeo Oita* Fumio Asamura and Katsuaki Sakamoto Nihon Dempa Kogyo Co. Ltd. Japan E-mail: oita@ndk.com Abstract The Butler and modified Butler-type crystal oscillator circuits have been selected as the,candidates to develop low-noise 100 MHz VHF crystal oscillators using SC-cut crystals. A low-noise buffer amplifier with a matching circuit to the 50-ohm output load is commonly used for these two design models. Evaluations of the phase noise performance have been achieved by comparing predicted performance and experimental results for the phase noise performance of each of the two types. The Butler-type phase noise is shown to be less than –162 dBc/Hz in actual results compared with the predicted value of –170 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz Fourier frequency. The modified Butler-type shows less than –171 dBc/Hz in actual results compared with the predicted value of –178 dBc/Hz at the same Fourier frequency.,2006

The clock employs a small spherical glass cell and exhibits a performance which is comparable to that of a commercial atomic clock. A resonance width of less than 200 Hz leads to short term stability of 3×10 -11 /√τ for time constants of 0.5 sec to 200 sec. The relative frequency stability is better than 10 -10 with a slow drift of only 0.1 mHz per day.,2006

Three different antenna sites on the roof of the NIST laboratories at Boulder Colorado were selected each with different multipath characteristics that we discuss. Simultaneous tests were conducted at each site with the same model of L1 band GPS receiver but with different types of antennas. Four different types of active antennas with low-noise amplifiers were used at each site: a patch antenna a patch antenna with a simple choke ring attached a quadrifilar helix and a “pinwheel” antenna with an aperture coupled slot array design. Results are presented that demonstrate how each antenna performs in each multipath environment with the time deviation (σ x ( τ )) used as a metric. We also discuss the potentially harmful effects on time transfer caused by RF interference from other active GPS antennas located on the same roof.,2006

In 2006 we have started to phase in the hardware for a new system still under development which should allow us to define UTC (CH) as a real time scale generated by a master clock i.e. a time scale defined for all epochs. The new system should preserve the advantages of the original system while improving reliability availability and compatibility with other UTC (k)’s.,2006

2006papers/poster1.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy and the Department of Defense since 1830 and in cooperation with other institutions has also,provided timing for the United States and the international community. Its Master Clock (MC) is the source of UTC (USNO) the USNO’s realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which has stayed within 5 ns RMS of UTC since 1999. The data used to generate UTC (USNO) are based upon 73 cesium and 21 hydrogen maser frequency standards in three buildings at two sites. The USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem LORAN Network Time Protocol (NTP) GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). The USNO would not be able to meet all the requirements of its users had it kept to the same technology it had 10 years ago; this paper describes some of the changes being made to meet the future needs for precision accuracy and robustness. Further details and explanations of our services can be found on-line at http://tycho.usno.navy.mil or by contacting the author directly. I. TIME GENERATION The most important part of the USNO Time Service Department is its staff which currently consists of 27 positions. Of these the largest group almost half the staff is directly involved in time transfer. The rest are fairly evenly divided between those who service the clocks those who monitor them and those who are working to develop new ones. The core stability of USNO time is based upon the clock ensemble. We currently have 69 HP5071 cesium clocks made by Hewlett-Packard/Agilent/Symmetricom four cesium Cs III-EP,2006

2004papers/paper11.pdf,REFLECTIONS ON TEN YEARS OF NETWORK TIME SERVICE Richard Schmidt Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392-5420 USA E-mail: res@tuttle.usno.navy.mil Abstract,The year 2004 marks the 10th anniversary since the start of U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) time dissemination on the Internet using the Network Time Protocol (NTP). In 1994 our service was inauspicious: two 50MHz/32MB servers on a 56kb WAN link handling one packet every 17 seconds. Today three servers in Washington D.C. process over five thousand packets per second from millions of clients across the U.S. and 63 other nations. At the USNO Alternate Master Clock at Schriever AFB Colorado two additional servers provide NTP. Seventeen USNO servers with embedded GPS provide U.S. regional coverage from Alaska to Hawaii from Washington state to Florida from southern California to Maine. For the past 6 years USNO has provided time service on the SIPRNET from Washington D.C. and Schriever AFB. SIPRNET timing will soon expand with remote SAASM GPS servers. Throughout its history USNO with the assistance of cooperating agencies has provided free public time dissemination from time balls to telegraphic time wireless broadcasts telephone time LORAN GPS and Internet time. NTP is lightweight reliable accurate and robust. Freely distributed it has been ported to numerous devices and operating systems. The architecture of NTP is permanently in evolutionary development and in remote system maintenance . I. EARLY TIME DISSEMINATION AT USNO The mission of the U. S. Naval Observatory is to:,2004

TL Taiwan 12 Lane 551 Min-Tsu Road Sec. 5 Yang-Mei Taoyuan Taiwan 326 Tel: 886 3 424 5179 Fax: 886 3 424 5474 E-mail: betrand@cht.com.tw Abstract,For short measurement times the Allan (or two-sample) variance can be determined from the phase noise using the mathematical conversion between time and frequency domain. This provides us with a useful tool to obtain the very short-term frequency stability ( τ ＜ 0.5 second) in the time domain which is difficult for a time-interval counter to measure because of its resolution limitations. Before carrying out the conversion bias from the measurement system and uncorrelated noises to the DUT (device under test) e.g. ac power noise and environmental perturbations are considered and corrected in the raw data. By doing this the proper characteristic of the DUT seems to be revealed reasonably. If the above-mentioned bias and noises were not corrected the generated variance would be apart from the corrected one irregularly depending on the sampling time τ . In this paper both the numerical integration and the power-law model are used to practice the conversion. The numerical integration is a straightforward way to use and we can get the integral approximation easily. In addition a common model for the phase noise is linear combinations of power law processes which are distinguished by the integer powers ( α,2004

2004papers/paper2.pdf,COPING WITH OVERLOAD ON THE NETWORK TIME PROTOCOL PUBLIC SERVERS 1 David Mills University of Delaware Judah Levine National Institute of Standards and Technology Richard Schmidt U.S. Naval Observatory and David Plonka University of Wisconsin Abstract,The public time servers operated by USNO and NIST provide time synchronization directly or indirectly to millions of Internet computers today. The load in the form of processor cycles and network traffic has doubled in the last 2 years and could eventually overwhelm the servers and the network infrastructure unless something is done about it. While both USNO and NIST operate multiple servers across the US the aggregate load is highly unbalanced and the flagship servers at headquarters are nearing capacity. This paper discusses the current conditions at USNO and NIST and suggests technical defenses designed to protect their resources. Surprisingly a significant fraction of the total load is due to the occasional defective client design that spews an alarming number of packets without good reason. In one incident at the University of Wisconsin a defective NTP implementation in a router product resulted in a large- scale denial of service attack on the university’s network. At NIST and USNO most of the population are well-behaved “mice ” but a significant proportion of the total traffic is due to a relatively few number of abusive “elephants.” The paper proposes that the best advice may be to find the elephants and shoot them.,2004

The acquisition of new hardware and the,development of new computer algorithms have increased the timing capability of the lab to a quality of service that permits the lab to be a contributor to the computation of International Atomic Time. In July the lab took delivery of a second Sigma Tau hydrogen maser bringing the facility’s complement of masers to three. The position of the lab’s GPS antenna was accurately surveyed greatly improving common-view time transfer accuracy and the installation of redundant phase microsteppers has made possible the steering of UTC (APL). The implementation of a time scale algorithm has combined the labs three masers and three cesiums into a stable Mean time reference and a UTC – UTC (APL) prediction algorithm based on the Mean has improved our capability to steer to the BIPM. While improving its timing capability the lab has continued to support development of three NASA spacecraft (Messenger Stereo and New Horizons) in addition to that of flight oscillator projects.,2004

2004papers/paper27.pdf,LEVERAGING THE AIR FORCE ENTERPRISE APPROACH TO TIME SYNCHRONIZATION: A PROPOSAL Glenn Bell and Jay Scarano The MITRE Corporation Bedford MA 01730 USA E-Mail: glennb@mitre.org and jgs@mitre.org Abstract,Net-centric warfare requires an unprecedented level of integration. Time synchronization is a key driver for that integration. The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) provides PTTI capability for the Department of Defense (DoD). To date we do not have a comprehensive method for distributing time from the USNO to systems with varying precision and accuracy requirements. The Air Force as part of its Common Integrated Infrastructure initiative has taken on this problem. The result is an Air Force Enterprise Time architecture that encompasses the USNO provided delivery mechanisms and provides the framework for delivery of pedigreed time to end systems. We offer the Air Force approach to achieving enterprise time delivery as a starting point for the DoD. Further details and explanations of CII Services can be obtained by contacting the authors directly. THE TIME CHALLENGE Net-Centric Warfare (NCW) has significant implications for military operations. NCW will change “the nature of our mission(s) the battlespace in which we operate our adversaries’ capabilities our ability to sense and understand the battlespace the capability of the weapons at our disposal and … our ability to command and control” [1] . Key to NCW is information superiority defined in Joint Publication 3-13 as “the capability to collect process and disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information while exploiting or denying an adversary’s ability”,2004
2004papers/opening.pdf,OPENING REMARKS LARA SCHMIDT (RAND Corporation):,Good morning and welcome to the 36 th Annual PTTI. We’ve got some great surroundings here on Capitol Hill this year so I encourage you to get out on your free time and look around. We have a fantastic program lined up this year courtesy of the Program Committee and our Technical Program Chair Dr. Ken Senior. We’ve got lots of good talks about timing timekeeping time transfer etc. Last night when I was watching Monday Night Football even Al Michaels was talking about atomic clocks so I knew this was going to be a great conference this year. Right now I would like to introduce the Superintendent of the Naval Observatory. He’s going to make some opening remarks today. Captain Tettlebach is the 49 th superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory. The USNO maintains the Master Clock for the United States and determines and provides precise time to the Department of Defense. The USNO also determines and promulgates the positions and motions of the earth and celestial bodies for precise navigation of DoD forces. Captain Tettlebach served as an oceanographer aboard the U.S.S. Saipan and made four deployments to McMerdo Station Antarctica. Aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt he served as oceanographer and provided METOC support to Commander Carrier Group 8. He served as the Executive Officer for the Naval National Ice Center in Suitland Maryland followed by duty in the Office of the Assistant,2004

2004papers/paper9.pdf,QUANTUM POSITIONING SYSTEM,Thomas B. Bahder U.S. Army Research Laboratory 2800 Powder Mill Road Adelphia MD 20783-1197 USA E-mail: bahder@arl.army.mil A quantum positioning system (QPS) is proposed that can provide a user with all four of his space-time coordinates. The user must carry a corner cube re- ﬂector a good clock and have a two-way classical channel of communication with the origin of the reference frame. Four pairs of entangled photons (bipho- tons) are sent through four interferometers: three interferometers are used to determine the user’s spatial position and an additional interferometer is used to synchronize the user’s clock to coordinate time in the reference frame. The spa- tial positioning part of the QPS is similar to a classical time-of-arrival (TOA) system; however a classical TOA system (such as GPS) must have synchro- nized clocks that keep coordinate time and therefore the clocks must have long- term stability whereas in the QPS only a photon coincidence counter is needed and the clocks need only have short-term stability. Several scenarios are consid- ered for a QPS: one is a terrestrial system and another is a space-based system,2004
2004papers/paper23.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy and the,Department of Defense since 1830 and in cooperation with other institutions has also provided timing for the United States and the international community. Its Master Clock (MC) is the source of UTC (USNO) the USNO’s realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which has stayed within 5 ns RMS of UTC since 1999. The data used to generate UTC (USNO) are based upon 73 cesium and 20 hydrogen maser frequency standards in three buildings at two sites. The USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem LORAN Network Time Protocol (NTP) GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). The USNO would not be able to meet all the requirements of its users had it kept to the same technology it had 10 years ago; this paper will describe some of the changes being made to meet the anticipated needs of our users for precision accuracy and robustness. Further details and explanations of our services can be found on-line at http://tycho.usno.navy.mil or by contacting the author directly. I. TIME GENERATION The most important part of the USNO Time Service Department is its staff which currently consists of 22 onboard employees. Of these the largest group about half the staff is directly involved in time transfer. The rest are fairly evenly divided between those who service the clocks those who monitor them and those who are trying to develop new ones. The core stability of USNO time is based upon our clock ensemble. We currently have 74 HP5071 cesium clocks made by Hewlett-Packard/Agilent 4 cesium CsIII-EP clocks made by,2004
2004papers/paper37.pdf,FREQUENCY EQUILIBRATION AND THE LIGHT-SHIFT EFFECT FOR BLOCK IIR GPS RUBIDIUM CLOCKS James Camparo Photonics Technology Department The Aerospace Corporation PO Box 92957 Los Angeles CA 90009 USA Abstract,Over the past several years evidence has grown indicating that rubidium (Rb) vapor-cell frequency standards exhibit a long “frequency equilibration” period following activation. Though frequency equilibration can have important implications for diverse timekeeping systems the mechanism driving the behavior is not well understood and has been the subject of debate. Here we investigate this phenomenon as well as frequency aging for a number of Block IIR GPS Rb clocks. Consistent with previous work we find that all six Rb clocks in the study showed a frequency equilibration phenomenon with time constants ranging from 98 to 584 days. Further all clocks displayed a strong correlation between clock frequency and light intensity during equilibration. Significantly five of the GPS clocks displayed small light- intensity jumps (~ 0.3%) that could be correlated with small jumps in clock fractional frequency (~ 3x10 -13 ); these were used to estimate the various clocks’ light-shift coefficients. The broad range of equilibration time constants and the light-shift coefficient determinations cast doubt on the two mechanisms most often cited to explain frequency equilibration: helium permeation through the resonance cell’s glass envelope and the intensity-dependent light-shift effect. Additionally the light-shift coefficient determinations cast doubt on the intensity-dependent light-shift effect as the driver of frequency aging.,2004
2004papers/paper35.pdf,DEVELOPMENTS IN ULTRA-STABLE QUARTZ OSCILLATORS FOR DEEP SPACE RELIABILITY Gregory Weaver Matthew Reinhart and Mihran Miranian Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD 20723-6099 USA Abstract For over four decades the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University,(JHU/APL) has supplied the U.S. military and commercial space sectors with a quartz oscillator of unsurpassed performance and reliability. Referred to as having Ultra-Stable performance this oscillator has been given the nomenclature of USO. The current USO at 1.2 kilograms and 1.1 watts steady-state power consumption features time- dependent drift (aging) of less than 1×10 -11 per day and fractional frequency variance approaching 1×10 -13 over the range of 1 to 100 seconds. Our paper will present performance data and describe the unique advantages afforded by the use of quartz oscillators in deep space including in-flight data that demonstrates no degradation to long-term frequency by repeated radiation exposures. We will also present an outlook of technology projects planned for the next 5 years including the use of Kalman filtering direct digital synthesis and alternative piezoelectric materials. We will present our viewpoint that further development in quartz resonators for space applications will only gain in importance as communication needs expand into interplanetary networks. I.,2004

2004papers/poster2.pdf,SETTING UP AN NTP SERVER AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY OF BELGIUM Fabian Roosbeek Pascale Defraigne and André Somerhausen Royal Observatory of Belgium Abstract This paper describes the setup of an NTP server for time synchronization via the Internet at the Royal Observatory of Belgium. The time server is realized by a “heartbeat” system of two PC servers connected to an NTS-3000 time server synchronized on three different sources: (1),UTC (ORB) our national time scale; (2) UTC broadcast by GPS satellite system; and (3) DCF- 77 System. The precision of the synchronization between our time server and the different time sources is a few microseconds. A remote synchronization on our server using the NTP protocol is directly traceable to UTC with an utmost precision of a few milliseconds when the synchronization is done under optimal conditions.,2004

2004papers/closing.pdf,CLOSING REMARKS JOE WHITE (U.S. Naval Research Laboratory):,It’s time for my favorite part of the meeting right before we go home. First of all thank you all for coming this year. It’s a good crowd. This was our first time at trying downtown. It’s probably our last time in a while at trying downtown I think. The hotel was kind of a mixing blessing here. We go back to Reston in 2006 so we’re going to go back out into the country again. There were a lot of interesting things this year. I think my favorite paper – and I’m not supposed to have a favorite paper -- but I think it had to be Prof. Mills’s paper. I really liked the idea of the elephants stomping and the kiss-of-death packets. It was just a nice touch. The other thing that I particularly liked was the interoperability panel yesterday afternoon. I think we brought out a lot of things that people needed to think about. I know that probably not all of us have thought of everything. I particularly thank Eduardo [Detoma] for all the work in putting that together. And of course there was a lot of new stuff this year on the chip-scale atomic clocks which was kind of nice from my standpoint. As usual we thank our exhibitors. They’re part of the people that make this meeting possible. It gives you a chance to look at what they’re doing find out what you want to buy. It gives them a chance to tell you what they’re doing and all in all it works out pretty well for everybody. So we’re happy about that. I think the big news at this point is something I’ve been reminding you about every year for the last couple years and that is next year is finally going to be the year that we do our joint meeting with [IEEE] Frequency Control [Symposium]. The schedule is late August and the thing to remember is that pushes,2004
2004papers/paper43.pdf,THE ALLAN VARIANCE AS AN ESTIMATOR OF THE LONG-MEMORY PARAMETER: TIME-DOMAIN AND WAVELET METHODS Lara S. Schmidt RAND Corporation James G. Skinner U.S. Naval Observatory Abstract The Allan variance is a well-known estimator of frequency stability and is often used to classify a time series into one of the standard clock noise types. By identifying the power-law,model for clock noise with its long-memory equivalent the Allan variance can also serve as an estimate for the long-memory parameter. Although the Allan variance is not a maximum likelihood estimator it can be used with regression techniques that employ minimum variance estimates. This work describes the analytic basis for using the Allan variance to estimate the memory parameter and performance of several Allan-variance-based estimators is illustrated via simulation study. Maximum likelihood estimation is also discussed and the performance of maximum-likelihood estimators is contrasted with that of the Allan-variance-based estimators.,2004

1995papers/paper27_32.pdf,BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION TIMING SYSTEM Kenneth E. Martin Bonneville Power Administration Vancouver Washington 98666 INTRODUCTION,The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is a power marketing agency for the U.S. Federal government. It was established to market power from the federal dams being constructed on the Columbia River and has evolved into the major bulk power supplier in the Pacific Northwest. BPA sells power produced at Federal generating facilities coordinates the Columbia river hydro system and transmits power for other utilities. Time is an integral part of BPA's operational systems. Generation and power transfers are planned in advance. Utilities coordinate with each other by making these adjustments on a timed schedule. Price varies with demand so billing is based on time. Outages for maintenance are scheduled to assure they do not interrupt reliable power delivery. Disturbance records are aligned with recorded timetags for analysis and comparison with related information. Advanced applications like traveling wave fault location and real-time phase measurement require continuous timing with high precision. Most of BPA is served by a Central Time System (CTS) at the Dittmer Control Center near Portland OR. This system keeps time locally and supplies time to both the control center systems and field locations via a microwave system. It is kept synchronized to national standard time and coordinated with interconnected utilities. It is the official BPA time. There are a few BPA applications which are not served by the CTS.

1971papers/paper03_06.pdf,MINI MODEM FOR PTTI DISSEMINATION,by J. A. Murray Jr. Mr. Murray is with the Time and Frequency Systems Unit Naval Research Laboratory Washington D.C. Precise comparisons of clocks are now regularly made over several Defense Satellite Communication System (DSCS) trunks employing communi- cations modems that use high-speed pseudo-random codes. Under the pri- mary sponsorship of the Naval Electronic Systems Command the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is continuing the development program to extend the use of the technique to certain other stations that are not equipped with appropriate modems. The Army has also contributed to the development fund- ing and will be furnished with a time transfer system between two of its satellite terminals. While the development effort is directed mainly at satellite time trans- fers the techniques and equipment may also be used in other communications systems such as line-of-sight microwave links. The techniques are in- tended to make use of existing communication facilities in a non-interferring manner wherever possible. Time comparisons were made over DSCS trunks using existing AN/URC-,1971
1971papers/paper03_12.pdf,THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ABSOLUTE PATH DELAY IN DIGITAL TRANSMISSION SYSTEMS,by R. A. Day Jr. Mr. Day is Chief Engineering Staff Office of Telecommunications National Security Agency Washington D.C. One useful aspect of synchronous digital transmission is that we are not limited by noise in any given link when connecting in tandem a number of links. In the FDM world the noise products are of critical importance in determining the number of tandem links permissible. A digital link op- erating without error for relatively long periods of time results in an opera- tional performance that typically equates to the error burst distribution of the individual links. Over the years we have observed a large number of digital links and many of these are very long and made up of numerous tandem links. We noted for example that the error burst distribution on a 3600-baud transatlantic data circuit between Frankfurt Germany and the Washington D.C. area was typically subjected to a short burst of errors approximately once every 20 minutes. We also noted that the modulation rate up to the circuit maximum,1971
1971papers/paper03_13.pdf,4-:N,DISCIPLINED TIME AND FREQUENCY OSCILLATOR rr: by ROBERT STONE Mr. Stone is the Head of the Time and Frequency Section of the Naval Re- search Laboratory Washington D.C. The aim of the PTTI Program is to provide to the user a coordinated time system that can be referenced to the Naval Observatory. Long-range transfers will be accomplished via the Defense Satellite Communications System satellite link and short-range transfers will be accomplished by microwave links UHF links or any other suitable system. In concept a centralized area (in a ship or a shore station) will con- tain the reference atomic standards (see Figure 1). Cables throughout the station will connect the reference standard to units called Disciplined Time Frequency Oscillators (DTFO). The DTFO is an important part of the concept; it separates the timekeeping function from the user-operator function and eliminates the necessity for frequent calibration which aids considerably,1971

1971papers/paper03_11.pdf,PRECISE TIME/FREQUENCY,FOR THE DEFENSE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM 11 by Harold C. Folts Mr. Folts is an Electronics Engineer at the Defense Communications Engi- neering Office Reston Virginia. The role of Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) in the Defense Communications System (DCS) is becoming significant as a result of increas- ing digital transmission rates and advancing communication technology. Dynamic advances in PTTI technology are providing high degrees of precision with reliability. Therefore it is now economically feasible to address the distribution and application of PTTI on a worldwide system basis. During November 1970 DCEO and NSA conducted a field test to determine the effects of system timing accuracy variations on the perform- ance of time division multiplexed (TDM) digital transmission trunks. The results showed that existing DCS timing facilities were not precisely on the same frequency and that these discrepancies had an adverse effect on the performance of the TDM circuits.,1971

This paper describes the time and frequency adjustments which are presently being made on the Loran-C system and those which will be made when some newer more sophisticated equipment has been installed. Last year the Loran-C system used as a medium for the dissemination of pre- cise time and time interval was discussed in some detail and is available in the proceedings . This paper concerns itself with time and frequency performance and adjustments on the Loran-C system. As a brief review a Loran-C chain consists of a master and two or more secondary stations as shown in Figure 1. In the hyperbolic naviga- tion mode constant time differences (between receipt of master and secon- dary station signals) form lines of position which are hyperbolas. A user,1971

I take great pleasure in coming over to these rather hallowed halls of the Naval Research Laboratory. May I remind you that our Naval Obser- vatory which CAPT Hankey represents is perhaps hallowed squared. It is one of the real beginnings of scientific endeavor in the United States. There has been a common Naval tradition across the wide world going back into the 1200 1300 and 1400 period of history when the Dutch the Portuguese and the British Navies became prominent. They ran into a very substantive need for fairly accurate time that is if they wanted to get back home to the wife and kids. Some of you may remember the famous stories of trying to find a chronometer and how they looked and what they were like when first built and how they cheated the chap that finally made it work for some,1971

We would like to go back to some fundamentals and present some of the aspects of noise and fluctuation on signals which lead to the characteristics of various types of precision signal sources. First we will discuss representations of signals and go into some of the simple noise relationships. We will talk about how signals can become contaminated and then consider some of the various stability measures that have been proposed and are in present use and then talk about the effects of frequency multiplication on precision sources and means for achieving low noise frequency multiplication. In addition we will consider some of the techniques for measuring stability and getting some of the numbers involved in stability measures. Last of all I will present some of the characteristics of available sources -- by no means an exhaustive list just a few. Figure 1 is a representation of a pure signal.,1971

1971papers/paper03_02.pdf,-) THE INCREMENTAL PHASE SHIFTER AND PRN TIME TRANSFER,by Dr. R.B. Kershner Dr. Kershner is Space Development Department Head Applied Physics Laboratory Silver Spring Maryland. An experiment is being planned which will be run early next summer from a satellite under development by the Applied Physics Laboratory for the Polaris people of the Navy. The satellite is basically an experimental satellite to determine the feasibility of some of the techniques planned for an eventual second generation replacement of the current operational Transit navigation satellites at some future date. It is clear that technology will ultimately move to where the current Transit satellites leave something to be desired although they are still meeting all existing requirements and are continuing to operate exceptionally well--much to the dismay of the current commercial producer who never gets the opportunity to launch any because the ones that are up there keep running. The oldest of the current operational series was launched just over four and one-half years ago. Whereas no one intends to go up and shoot them down the advance of technology will ultimately make them obsolete.,1971

The Long Range Position Determining System(LRPDS)is being developed by the Army Engineer Topographic Laboratories. The LRPDS is designed to provide a rapid survey and positioning capability for the Field Army. The basic design goals for LRPDS are: The system must be capable of determining 24 positions within one mission. The area of operation may be as wide as 200 km. The mission should be accomplished in less than one hour. The position accuracy may vary from 5 meters to 40 meters depending on where the position is located. The weight of one back-pack unit should not exceed 25 pounds. The communication links of the system should be Jam resistant and difficult to detect. Some of the significant design characteristics are as follows:,1971

This paper is about the fiber optic development work that has been going on at the Naval Electronics Laboratory Center particularly an appli- cation for PTTI dissemination. I really don't know how old Fiber Optics happens to be I think the Venetians probably started it in their glass work. I have been told that it is rediscovered every generation and I think that it's about to be discovered again. One of the advantages of using fiber optic for transmitting data is that it is secure from radiation leakage. This is of benefit not only for secure systems for communications but also for preventing cross-talk. Being glass they provide no grounding problems they are free of RF interference and they are small and lightweight. To give an idea of the weight reduction glass is about 150 to 208 pounds,1971

1971papers/paper03_20.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY RELATING TO COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM o-,by J. L. Brennan Mr. Brennan is Sub-Program Manager of Collision Avoidance Systems Federal Aviation Administration Washington D.C. This paper is a discussion of the history of the collision avoidance program and the current status of FAA plans and requirements. First how- ever some basic definitions will be presented. A collision avoidance system (CAS) is an all-weather system which detects all potentially dan- gerous intruders automatically evaluates the degree of the threat and if necessary indicates a safe evasive manuever to the pilot. A cooperative system is one which is only capable of detecting those aircraft which are equipped with the same cooperating system; that is there is an active exchange of information between the aircraft. A non-cooperative system would protect against any other aircraft equippedor not. While our objec- tive is the development of non-cooperative systems it is a fact today that the most promising CAS is a cooperative system. The primary mission of the FAA is the safe and efficient movement of air traffic with the emphasis on safety; as such the entire traffic control system can be thought of as a collision avoidance system. However the,1971

Figure 2 is a photograph of an experimental hydrogen maser which was designed and put together in late 1966 or early 1967. This particular maser has had over four years of continuous operation and has operated most of that time as a basic frequency standard. Figure 3 shows NP-1 which is a NASA prototype atomic hydrogen standard. It was the first of four models which we built and was completed in late 1968.

Over the past 32 years these meetings have continued to provide the timing community with an opportunity for users to present their ideas and requirements for improving the ability of the timing community to meet the nation's needs. Similarly these conferences have allowed time and time interval providers to make system developers aware of the latest improvements in the field. The objectives of the series of meetings namely to disseminate and coordinate PTTI information at the user level; to review present and future PTTI requirements; to inform government engineers technicians and managers of precise time and frequency technology; and to provide opportunity for an active exchange of new technology associated with PTTI are more important today than ever before. Since the first PTTI meetings the precision with which time and time interval are measured and transferred has improved by three orders of magnitude a factor of 10 per decade. We have witnessed remarkable growth in the use of precise time and frequency. It is safe to say that the development of precise time has played a critical role in the growth of technology that touches all of,2000

Minimize bureaucracy that clouds the system requirements and significantly increases product cost. In order to achieve this objective the following recommendations came out from the panel discussion: 1. Initiate additionel educational program through technical confrences or industry lecture series to improve the dialog between system designer supplier end user and all of the support services (quality control material processes documentation). 2.

As of January of this year an official memorandum of agreement was signed between the DoD and the DOT which effectively establishes it as a permanent service through the year 2005 to be used by DOT and the civilian sector. And so we have as you might say an opportunity to utilize this; and certainly it has been but it is a matter of recognizing the tremendous momentum that exists in the civilian community utilizing the service that GPS can provide. The committee CGSIC is a civil GPS interface committee. It was set up specifically in agreement between DoD and DOT so that information can flow - it is really an information-,1993

One thing that has happened since the symposium became part of the IEEE is that our name has gotten much longer. It used to be the ""Annual Symposium on Frequency Control;"" it's now the IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium. The 1993 symposium was held in Salt Lake City. We had 129 paper summaries that we received; we accepted 104. Many papers were combined and that is one of the reasons that it perhaps looks like we had many more rejections than we really did. But there were 12 tutorial sessions four separate tracks three sessions per track; and we now have the auspices of Dave Allan as essentially a permanent tutorial chair to make sure that our tutorials end up having some coherence from year to year. Rather than giving the same talk over and over again we can actually now plan out several years in advance. We think it is quite effective.

2002papers/paper49.pdf,KALMAN FILTER CHARACTERIZATION OF CESIUM CLOCKS AND HYDROGEN MASERS Lee A. Breakiron U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392-5420 USA Abstract Our previous PTTI paper demonstrated that a two-state Kalman filter involving the parameters frequency and frequency drift when properly implemented produces frequencies,for hydrogen masers that generate a stable mean timescale at least for cases involving simulated and low-noise real data. The current paper extends the investigation to the noisier data actually employed in the USNO operational timescale. Results for about 500 days of postprocessed data for 12 masers and 51 cesium clocks indicate comparable frequency stabilities to those obtained with the currently operational timescale algorithm.,2002

2002papers/paper6.pdf,ONE-WAY GPS TIME TRANSFER: 2002 PERFORMANCE Steven Hutsell 1Lt Matthew Forsyth and Capt Charles B. McFarland 2d Space Operations Squadron 300 O’Malley Avenue STE 44 Schriever AFB CO 80912-3041 USA Abstract The Global Positioning System (GPS) among other duties serves countless worldwide precise,time users. These users are both civilian and military are located on ground in air at sea and in space. The respective missions of these users span metrology & calibration research & development test & evaluation communication synchronization and surveillance. The vast majority of these users employ what is called “one-way” synchronization using GPS. One-way synchronization allows users to realize precise time autonomously and anonymously using the direct precise time broadcast of GPS. Using data collected processed and provided by the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) the authors present an analysis of one-way GPS time transfer performance for FY 2002 utilizing a metric in use since the Initial Operational Capability (IOC) of GPS. This metric describes how well a fixed (surveyed) location user employing an authorized receiver tracking one satellite at a time can obtain precise time using GPS one-way synchronization without any special augmentation. The performance one-way users experience will vary depending on the particular application. Though no one metric can possibly represent all types of users the fixed-location analysis provides other types of users a baseline for deriving theoretical assessments of performance that can fairly represent their respectively unique applications.,2002

Strada Antica di Collegno 253 10146 Torino Italy Abstract,The possibility of using the Coherent Population Trapping (CPT) mechanism for the implementation of atomic frequency standards was proposed in the last decade and experimental work is currently being carried on in various laboratories. The Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale (IEN) “G. Ferraris ” with the support of Alenia Spazio is currently developing under an ESA contract a Rb CPT maser frequency standard prototype (breadboard) with the aim to evaluate its ultimate stability capabilities in the range from 1 s to 1 day. The expected short-term stability is 10 -12 τ -1/2 with a flicker floor of 10 -14 . This stability performance if achieved would be of great interest for the Galileo satellite navigation system lying between the stability performances of a traditional lamp-pumped rubidium and that of a passive H-maser with a significant reduction of complexity. PROJECT GOAL While looking at possible clock implementations suitable for space applications the CPT maser technology is rather new and it has not yet completely investigated to understand its ultimate,2002
2002papers/paper5.pdf,COMBINING TIME TRANSFER MEASUREMENTS USING A KALMAN FILTER J. A. Davis P. W. Stacey P. M. Harris and M. G. Cox National Physical Laboratory Queens Road Teddington Middlesex TW11 0LW UK Abstract Time transfer measurements made between UTC (k) timing laboratories are routinely performed using a variety of satellite-based methods. The National Physical Laboratory has,undertaken a study of combining time transfer measurements from separate links between two laboratories where each link measures the same clock difference. The aim is to produce a time series of (composite) time-transfer measurements that has appreciably less measurement noise than any of the component measurements. A Kalman filter is used to combine the measurements. The method is developed to treat some of the known characteristics of satellite time transfer measurements. These include time series having different measurement intervals and slowly changing delays occurring within the time transfer hardware. The treatment of missing data and the addition and removal of individual links are also examined.,2002

Abstract An overview of past accomplishments is presented that shows the development of satellite time transfer techniques and capabilities that are used today. The development is traced from the concepts and early demonstrations using a single satellite to the global coverage now pro-,vided by a constellation of satellites. Predictions of future technology are compared with what has been accomplished over the last 25 years. Co-operative experiments performed jointly by colleagues of the PTTI Meetings were key to the development. These experiments demonstrated the potential of time transfer by satellites having global coverage. Some of the results are re- viewed and compared to current capabilities.,2002

2002papers/paper3.pdf,ANALYSIS OF ONE YEAR OF ZERO-BASELINE GPS COMMON-VIEW TIME TRANSFER AND DIRECT MEASUREMENT USING TWO CO-LOCATED CLOCKS Gerrit de Jong and Erik Kroon NMi Van Swinden Laboratorium P.O. Box 654 2600 AR Delft the Netherlands Abstract,As part of the Galileo project of Early Trials on Time Synchronization Techniques and Calibration Issues the (near) zero-baseline GPS Common-View Time Transfer and Direct Measurement (using a Time Interval Counter) results between the time scales of two co-located clocks during 2001 were analyzed. This was done to identify the obtainable uncertainty levels with these techniques. The result of the analysis is presented. The baseline of the antennas of the two single-channel NBS-type GPS C-V receivers was 2 m so multi-path influence is not excluded. The uncertainties from statistical origin (Type A evaluation) were determined by means of MDEV and TDEV. The uncertainties from other sources (Type B evaluation) were determined from calibrations. The TDEV of the GPS C-V result was less than 0.4 ns at averaging times > 1 day and at shorter averaging times TDEV was about 1 ns.,2002

First data were submitted in June 2002 and by the end of 2002 close to ten laboratories routinely submitted such data. This paper presents the results of several time links computed with this data set and compares them to those obtained by other time transfer techniques. The achieved stability shows improvements with respect to other techniques presently used for TAI links and the achieved accuracy is consistent with that expected from uncertainty in calibration.,2002

2002papers/paper19.pdf,RESPONSE OF A GEOSYNCHRONOUS SPACECRAFT’S CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR TO SOLAR FLARES: RESULTS OF A “SPACE EXPERIMENT” J. Camparo A. Presser S. Lalumondiere and S. Moss The Aerospace Corporation PO Box 92957 Los Angeles CA 90009 USA Abstract Viewing the frequency history of the high-quality quartz crystal oscillator onboard Milstar,FLT-1 as a “space experiment ” we examined the response of the crystal to various solar flares occurring over the past 4 years. One of the questions we address concerns the influence of enhanced space radiation on a crystal oscillator’s random frequency fluctuations which in addition to radiation-induced deterministic effects could affect the oscillator’s timekeeping ability. Examining the response of the Milstar FLT-1 crystal oscillator to the large solar flares of 14 July and 9 November 2000 we find clear evidence of a flare-induced deterministic change in oscillator frequency. However examining the random fluctuations of the oscillator’s frequency about this deterministic variation we find no evidence of a concomitant change in the nature of the oscillator’s stochastic behavior. Additionally we examined the magnitude of the radiation-induced frequency excursion for a number of solar flares obtaining a scaling relation between maximum frequency excursion and solar proton fluence as measured by GOES satellites. The results show that even for the largest flares timekeeping onboard a geosynchronous communications satellite need not be unduly perturbed by the enhanced space- radiation environment of a solar flare so long as a ground station can take mitigating action within a few hours of the flare’s onset. Though limited to a unique satellite experiment the results reported here bode well for satcom timekeeping during periods of solar maximum.,2002

2002papers/opening.pdf,OPENING REMARKS Captain Dave Gillard Superintendent U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA,It is a pleasure to be here and good morning ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to open this to bring all of you together to coordinate activities review present and future requirements and bring the newest developments to the attention of all of our colleagues here that have remained the same since the first meeting (many of them). Decreasing budgets smaller staffs and most importantly at least for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) increasing reliance on timing systems through naval-advanced assured and interoperable war-fighting capabilities make this meeting more important now than ever before. Over the next three days there will be nearly 50 papers scheduled for presentation during the various sessions. Current and future means for time transfer dominate most of the topics this year. There are papers that discuss GPS system performance and the use of GPS for time transfer and a good number of papers that discuss Galileo timing and the space-based clock development. Several papers address the issues faced by two-way time transfer and frequency transfer and new data processing methods that will allow us to look at old data with a completely new perspective. The DoD regards PTTI as a very important element in maintaining interoperability among its systems and war fighters. And by way of illustration I would like to show you just one example of how this becomes important. This will illustrate the Navy’s strategic vision called Sea Power 21 . This is unique to the Navy but in terms of its use of timing it is not unique to the Navy. All,2002

2002papers/paper32.pdf,THE CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR CHARACTERIZATION FACILITY AT THE AEROSPACE CORPORATION S. Karuza M. Rolenz A. Moulthrop A. Young and V. Hunt The Aerospace Corporation El Segundo CA 90245 USA Abstract At the present time there is a need by the military for small low-power fast-warmup and low g-sensitivity crystal oscillators for use in GPS receivers and transmitters in handheld,survival radios and smart munitions. These units require a stable frequency source (crystal oscillators or small rubidium atomic clocks) for their operation. A variety of crystal oscillators are now on the market and there is a need to evaluate the latest technology so that performance can be compared and evaluated. Insight into the characteristics of the various classes of crystal oscillators used by the contractors enables The Aerospace Corporation to identify the performance risks early in program development which helps avoid schedule delays and later cost impacts. This paper describes a modernized clock-oscillator measurement facility that has been established at Aerospace to characterize these frequency sources in support of the military programs. MEASUREMENT SYSTEM In our frequency stability measurement system we used the heterodyne single-mixer method [1] to measure the frequency fluctuations of the frequency source under test as shown in Figure 1. The signal from the oscillator to be tested is mixed with a reference oscillator of almost the same frequency as the oscillator under test. This is done so that one is left with a lower average frequency (beat frequency) for analysis without reducing the phase or frequency fluctuations themselves. In our measurement system we have improved the measurement capability by using more up-to-date hardware and software as will be described in our paper. Figure 2 shows the frequency stability measurement system. The system consists of the 5 and 10 MHz,2002

2002papers/panel.pdf,PANEL DISCUSSION THE FUTURE OF CLOCK TECHNOLOGY FOR SPACE Joe White Moderator U.S. Naval Research Laboratory JOE WHITE:,The topic this morning is about the future of clock technology for space. You have seen a lot this morning in the earlier papers about things that will happen hopefully in the future of GPS and Galileo. We saw some things yesterday about GLONASS. And we decided that it was worth a little more discussion with some of the principles in it let people kind of argue with each other about which way things are going and what it is going to take to make it all work. We have an all-star panel here this morning: Ron Beard (U.S. Naval Research Laboratory) Martin Bloch (Frequency Electronics Incorporated) Lt. Jason Bolger (GPS Joint Program Office USAF); Mike Garvey (Symmetricom formerly Frequency Time Systems and Datum) Professor Leschiutta (Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale Italy) and finally Pascal Rochat (Temex Neuchâtel Time SA). What I would like to talk about here today is the nature of the problem. I did a paper last year where we talked about what made space clocks different than ground clocks. And the last thing I mentioned in that paper was the fact that GPS is in a way its own worst enemy. GPS has fantastic clocks in the satellites; it does very well. And that is really the problem: it makes atomic clocks unnecessary in some applications. So the concern is are we necessarily going to have atomic clocks when we need them for various space programs? The first thing that comes to mind is how many people actually need atomic clocks. And the list is fairly short.,2002

We estimate the time error x and fractional frequency offset y employing the finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters namely: the simple moving average (MA) the second order low pass (LP) and the optimally unbiased (OU). The estimates are pro- vided analytically and we show that in terms of a minimum root-mean-square error (RMSE) the simple MA is best to use for x estimates when 1 0 y y < ≤ the second-order LP FIR is best if 2 1 y y y < <,2002

2002papers/paper42.pdf,RECENT TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT PTB D. Piester P. Hetzel and A. Bauch Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Bundesallee 100 D-38116 Braunschweig Germany Abstract Recent activities in the field of time and frequency metrology pursued at PTB are reviewed. Quasi-continuous operation of the cesium fountain frequency standard CSF1 enabled us to assess the performance of the older primary clocks CS1 and CS2 much better,than previously possible. On average the CSF1 and CS2 frequencies deviated by less than 5 parts in 10 15 during more than 2 years which is well within the 1 σ uncertainty u B of CS2 12 parts in 10 15 . In cooperation with BIPM and timing institutes in the US and Europe several calibration exercises have been conducted that resulted in an improved calibration of PTB’s time comparison equipment.,2002
2002papers/closing.pdf,CLOSING REMARKS JOE WHITE (U.S. Naval Research Laboratory):,It’s that time again. I think what we have got left now are the hard-core PTTI faithful and the people whose flights have been cancelled. But either way I am happy that you are still here. This is where I usually do my Oprah imitation and we walk around and talk to people and see how you like the meeting. I tell you what I like what I didn’t like. First of all I was very pleased this year that we were able to give the PTTI Award to Harry Peters. In fact Harry since you are sitting here there is another round of applause for you. Congratulations. I also had a very good time last night at Steve Dick’s history of the Naval Observatory. A lot of things I had no idea that they had done in the past or the nature of the people who had done them. Our other accomplishments: We finally got the 2001 Proceedings out. Most of you probably have two copies. We are learning; we are learning slowly unfortunately but we are learning and I think this year we will do a bit better. What we had been doing in the past was making actually a hardcopy Proceedings and then making a softcopy Proceedings. And that procedure is not working well anymore so this year will be our first year at all-digital and hopefully that will resolve a lot of these things and it will get out to you a lot quicker. Credit cards: You know we tried a few years back to do that and it was a dismal failure. The past couple of years we have tried a new approach. And we had a dozen or so people use that something in that range. So we have made some headway there; it is only available right now to people who have pre- registered but at least that possibility is there. [Citibank has since cancelled our service.] It is almost time to roll the credits but let’s just go to the people who actually contributed a lot to this meeting. Andy of course is not here; he wound up having a rather sudden operation last week but I,2002
2002papers/paper43.pdf,RECENT ACTIVITIES IN THE FIELD OF TIME AND FREQUENCY IN POLAND Jerzy Nawrocki Astrogeodynamical Observatory Borowiec near Poznań and Central Office of Measures Warsaw Poland Abstract The work of main time laboratories in Poland concentrates on the improvement of national time scales UTC (PL) and TA (PL) and the development of new time receivers.,The Polish Independent Atomic Time Scale TA (PL) is obtained as the weighted average of about eight atomic clocks working at different laboratories in Poland and its long-term stability is about 5·10 -15 . In the recent years the important achievement was the development of the TTS-2 multi-channel GPS time receiver based on Motorola VP Oncore engine. At present a new time transfer receiver based on Javad Legacy card is under development . This paper provides the first results obtained with TTS-3.,2002

Three Hewlett-Packard model 5071 high performance cesium frequency standards were transported from the USNO in Washington DC to Los Angeles California in the USNO's mobile earth station. %a-Way Satellite Time Transfer links between the mobile earth station and the USNO were conducted each day of the trip using the Naval Research Laboratory(NRL) designed spread spectrum modem built by Allen Osborne Associates(A0A). A Motorola six channel GPS receiver was used to track the location and altitude of the mobile earth station and to provide coordinates for calculating Sagnac corrections for the two-way measurements and relativistic corrections for the cesium clocks. This paper will discuss the trip the measurement systems used and the results from the data collected. We will show the accuracy of using two-way satellite time transfer for synchronization and the performance of the three HP 5071,1994

1994papers/paper26_05.pdf,WORKSHOP 1; REAL WORLD USER REQUIREMENTS,Some of the problem areas discussed were: Incomplete specifications from users. User either doesn't know enough about the subject to give complete specifications or is not capable of generating the necessary specifications for his appication. The supplyer can't get complete specifications as a result. Incomplete specifications from suppliers. The suppliers/manufacturers usually supply the basic generic information on the units expecting the user to bz able to ask the specific questions pertaining to the particular application. Many users are unaware that other (non-standard and usually not tested) specifications may be available at an increased wst that will make the unit under question fit his application. The problem here is a lack of communication between the suplier and user. Often the supplier could eliminate some of the possible trouble later on by careful questioning of the user as to the exact application.

Future focus on guidelines for the time and frequency community should be ""dynamic (time-dependent) effects/environmental changes."" This may include recommendations for studies and research needed. User environmental effects are particularly difficult to characterize because of the prob- lems encountered in mapping manufacturers' specifications (sensitivity coefficients for the individual environmental sensitivities) into the overlappingJinteracting actual environments. Resol~~tion often requires expensive simulation of an actual environment. The following suggestions were made: - Users to characterize both (and independently) the systems' environment for the T&F components (e.g. cables voltages and fluctuations internal temperatures etc.) and the environment of the system itself. -",1994

1994papers/paper26_03.pdf,Navy PTTI Report CDR. JIM BURTON United States Navy Abstract,The U.S. Naval Observatory is charged under Department of Defense (DoD) instruction 5000.2 with the responsibility for maintaining the timing standard in support of all DoD operations. Accomplishment of this task involves generating a time reference and then disseminating the Precise Time and Time lnlerval (PTTI) information to users within as well as outside DoD. A major effort has been undertaken by Navy scientists in recent years to upgrade and improve these services. Understanding the characteristics of atomic clocks such as hydrogen masers cesium beamfrequency standards and stored ion devices is a prerequisite for modelling their performance and developing the most stable time reference possible. Algorithms for optimum clock ensembling and precision clock steering must be developed to ensure the stability of the lime reference. Implementing new methods for time transfer such as two-way satellite time transfer and laser ranging will lead to improved accuracies to lass then ons nanosecond. In addition the determination of astronomical time based on the Earth's rotation and definition of parameters for the position of the poles enable the correction of,1994

To choose the suitable oscillator one should consider its frequency - temperature stability power consumption size cost phase noise and other specifications. According to a lot of experiments and comparisons as the precision TCXO double compensated TCXO which combines analog and digital compensation approaches together is more competitive in cost size stability and mass production compared with ordinary precision TCXO DTCXO and MCXO based on AT cut crystals. It is difficult to use ordinary TCXO to get a very good frequency – temperature stability but its repeatability can be good with suitable components and circuits and quantization error does not exist in it. Therefore it is possible to be compensated further. TCXO production technology is very,2005

2005papers/paper28.pdf,Abstract— In this paper we present our design and prospects of a Magneto-Optical Trap (MOT)-based cold Cs-beam atomic clock physics package and report the realization and,characterization of a continuous laser-cooled Cs atomic beam from a Cs MOT. We have determined the longitudinal velocity of the cold Cs beam by Time of Flight (TOF) method to be 7 m/s with a velocity spread of 1 m/s. By adjusting the MOT parameters we are able to tune the Cs-beam velocity from 5 m/s to 8.5 m/s while the velocity spread remains to be 1m/s. The Cs beam has an instantaneous atomic flux of 3.6 × 10 10 atoms/s when operated in pulsed mode and a continuous beam flux of 2 × 10 8 atoms/s. Our theoretical simulation reveals that the MOT inhomogeneous magnetic field and the varying Doppler shift along the atomic beam propagation play an important role in determining the longitudinal velocity of the Cs atomic beam. With the cold Cs beam thus formed and a,2005

Maleki Jet Propulsion Lab California Institute of Technology Pasadena CA 91109-8099 USA John.D.Prestage@JPL.NASA.GOV Abstract — We have recently completed a breadboard ion-clock physics package based on Hg ions shuttled between a quadrupole and a 16-pole rf trap. With this architecture we,have demonstrated short-term stability ~2-3x10 -13 at 1 second averaging to 10 -15 at 1 day. This development shows that H- maser quality stabilities can be produced in a small clock package comparable in size to an ultra-stable quartz oscillator required for holding 1-2x10 -13 at 1 second. This performance was obtained in a sealed vacuum configuration where only a getter pump was used to maintain vacuum. We have selected materials for the vacuum tube ion trap and UV windows that will allow a 450 C tube bake-out to prepare for tube seal-off. This approach to the vacuum follows the methods used in flight vacuum tube electronics such as flight TWTA’s where tube operation lifetime and shelf life of up to 15 years is achieved. We have made a thorough study of residual gas shifts of the ion-clock frequency and a study of alternate noble gasses,2005

2005papers/paper97.pdf,NGA GPS Monitor Station High-Performance Cesium Frequency Standard Stability: From NGA Kalman Filter Clock Estimates Dennis M. Manning National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency GPS Branch/L-22 3838 Vogel Road Arnold Missouri 63010 USA E-mail: dennis.m.manning@nga.mil Abstract,The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) operates a worldwide network of GPS monitoring stations that utilizes high-performance cesium frequency standards (CFS) and geodetic quality GPS receivers. The NGA Monitor Station Network (MSN) has been in operation for almost 20 years and has recently moved to a 24/7 operation. The NGA monitor station CFS are located in non-laboratory environments and in some instances are logistically challenging. With the onset of the Department of Defense GPS Accuracy Improvement Initiative (Aii) the NGA monitor station cesiums along with the associative electronics must be monitored more frequently for quality control. Aii involves the Air Force Operational Control Segment (OCS) at Schriever AFB to incorporate a subset of the NGA monitor stations in real-time processing to improve the quality of the broadcast ephemeris and clock parameters. The addition of these stations will also expand the network coverage to allow all GPS satellites to be monitored without any gaps. This paper is a summary of the stability of the NGA MSN cesiums using one year (52 weeks) of Kalman Filter clock estimate data computed daily at the NGA facility in St. Louis. The quality of the CFSs to be shown and summarized in this report is from eleven NGA monitor stations which are to be added to the OCS estimation process under Aii. Results show that the NGA configuration of CFS has maintained the industry standards for high performance cesiums. This gives the NGA GPS program some of the most reliable monitor station clock data to support current and future GPS navigation systems.,2005

1972papers/paper04_16.pdf,HAWAIl PTTI TEST BED James A. Murray Naval Research Laboratory,The Navy's Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) program concerns many systems hav- ing to do with communications navigation and other time-coordinated activities. To assess the ability of the current PTTI research and development efforts to serve these systems a test bed is being established. The Naval Communication Station at Wahiawa Hawaii was selected for the site because of its involvement in or proximity to a number of activities that are either dependent upon the Naval Observatory as a common refer- ence or could benefit from the presence of accurate time and frequency standards. A prime goal in the effort is to develop a repertoire of techniques and equipment that will permit cornrnunications facilities to be served most effectively by their ties to a common time reference. The test bed will provide guidance for the implementation of precise time and frequency discipline at other facilities One product of the test-bed problem will be an assessment of the accuracy of the time- discipline chain from the Observatory to each level of use. While it is possible to estimate potential accuracies from equipment and media characteristics the practical accuracies,1972

TL Taiwan 12 Lane 551 Min-Tsu Road Sec. 5 Yang-Mei Taoyuan Taiwan 326 Tel: 886 3 424 5179 Fax: 886 3 424 5474 E-mail: betrand@cht.com.tw Abstract We have done some work to reveal that Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) sampling may,induce unreasonable Allan deviation (ADEV) values while the numerical integration is used for the time and frequency (T&F) conversion. These ADEV errors occur because parts of the FFT sampling have no contributions to the ADEV calculation for some τ . For example when averaging interval τ = 0.004 (s) and Fourier frequency f = 250 (Hz) the term sin ( πτ f) which plays a key role in the mathematical conversion is zero. If FFT sampling in a specific frequency range is only at multiples of 250 (Hz) spectral density in this range has no contributions to ADEV calculations for τ = 0.004 × N (s) where N is a positive integer. Our lab has also found such errors in related commercial software. In order to solve this problem without skipping over effects from certain values of τ we try to change the original sampling data in several ways like dividing sampling spaces into narrower ones or shifting the,2007

2007papers/poster9.pdf,MODELING PHASE-LOCKED LOOPS USING VERILOG Jeffrey Meyer Director of Engineering Symmetricom Inc. 3750 West Wind Blvd. Santa Rosa CA 95403 USA Abstract,An essential component of any mixed signal embedded system is a Phase-Locked Loop (commonly know as PLL). Almost every mixed signal system has one or more PLL in its block diagram. Phase-locked loops are used for a variety of tasks like multiplying clock frequencies generating precise clock phases and generating complex RF modulated signals like phase modulation. Many modern field programmable gate array devices come with integrated PLL to multiply clocks or adjust the phase of clock outputs. Modeling PLLs has always been difficult because they are part analog and part digital. Circuits that are both analog and digital are called “Analog Mixed Signal” or abbreviated as AMS. In the most basic block diagram of a PLL (Figure 1) the building blocks of the PLL are identified. The voltage-controlled oscillator (or VCO) the charge pump (or loop amplifier) and the loop filter are all analog blocks. The phase detector and dividers are digital blocks. Because the PLL is composed of both analog and digital blocks it is called mixed signal. The PLL is a feedback loop that adjusts the phase and frequency of the VCO to lock to the phase of the input reference oscillator. When the PLL is locked the output frequency is a fractional multiple of the input frequency (see eq. 1.0). F out / N = F ref / R or F out,2007

Weiss Time and Frequency Division National Institute of Standards and Technology Boulder CO 80305 USA E-mail: vzhang@boulder.nist.gov Abstract,The International GNSS Service (IGS) clock products contain clock information about the local reference for the IGS tracking receivers with respect to the IGS time. The clock information is obtained from GPS carrier-phase measurements. Many timing laboratories now operate IGS tracking receivers using high-quality clocks as the local reference. The IGS clock products allow timing laboratories to use the GPS carrier-phase measurements for comparing these clocks without significant postprocessing by the user. In this paper we study the stability of remote clock comparisons performed with the IGS clock products during the past 2 years. We compare the remote clock differences obtained with the IGS clock products to the remote clock comparisons with two-way satellite time and frequency transfer and GPS common view. We focus on the long-term differential performance of these transfer systems on the order of many months.,2007

2007papers/paper7.pdf,THE IN-FLIGHT FREQUENCY BEHAVIOR OF TWO ULTRA-STABLE OSCILLATORS ONBOARD THE NEW HORIZONS SPACECRAFT J. Robert Jensen and Gregory Weaver JHU/Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD USA E-mail: bob.jensen@jhuapl.edu Abstract The New Horizons spacecraft has been on its extensive journey to Pluto Charon and the,Kuiper Belt since January 2006. New Horizons uses two ultra-stable quartz oscillators as onboard references for radio science and the communications transceiver. One USO is configured as primary and the other is maintained in a “warm-boot” backup mode. The implementation of the transceiver for noncoherent navigation provides the opportunity for precise determination of the intrinsic USO frequency behavior during travel through deep space. In this paper we report on the frequency behavior observed since launch. We show the effects of general and special relativity including the Shapiro delay and present the differences in the spacecraft reference frequency history when observed from different frames of reference. Both USO frequency behaviors demonstrated distinct interaction with Jupiter’s radiation belt during the period prior to closest approach in February 2007. The frequency drifts are -1.33 × 10 -11 / day and +0.98 × 10 -11 /day with each USO demonstrating a slight decrease in drift rate from that determined immediately after launch. I.,2007

Reinhart JHU/Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD USA E-mail: mihran.miranian@jhuapl.edu Abstract In past years we have reported on continuous improvement in the operation of the master clock of our Time and Frequency Laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. We,have discussed our ensemble of hydrogen maser and cesium beam atomic frequency standards into an autonomous timescale that maintains UTC (JHU/APL) within ± 20 ns per month of UTC. This year since completing the major aspects of our laboratory refurbishment we have undertaken systems analysis toward optimization and improved timekeeping. In our paper we will describe the system of clocks control mechanisms and their relationship that maintain our laboratory’s accuracy. One outcome will describe the determination of our worst performing clock through frequency characterization and the performance improvement in the UTC (JHU/APL) timescale through selectively weighting its contribution.,2007
2007papers/paper5.pdf,ATOMIC AND QUARTZ CLOCK HARDWARE FOR COMMUNICATION AND NAVIGATION SATELLITES* Leo A. Mallette The Boeing Company Los Angeles CA 90009 USA Abstract Accurate and stable frequency reference sources are critical for commercial navigation military and scientific space applications. Each piece of flight hardware has requirement-types,that are generic such as size weight power and reliability and requirement-types that are specific to the hardware function. The key requirement-types for frequency reference sources are phase noise and stability. Both are important for satellites but stability is especially important for navigation satellites. Several levels of frequency references are suitable for space applications. This paper discusses similarities and differences among single distributed oscillators for communications satellites master oscillator groups for communications systems and atomic clocks for military and navigation systems.,2007
2007papers/paper4.pdf,CRITICAL POINTS AND TECHNICAL APPROACH IN THE E-OSPF TIME SYNCHRONIZATION AND PREDICTION ACTIVITIES María D. Laínez Samper Pedro F. Navarro Madrid and Miguel M.

The user positioning and integrity performances are highly dependent on the level of accuracy that can be achieved when the clock estimation and prediction techniques are applied to the generation of the navigation information. This article is aimed at presenting the latest timing approaches prototyped in the E-OSPF (Experimental Orbitography and Synchronization Processing Facility) and the obtained results related to the clock estimation technique the clock prediction fitting strategy and specific solutions designed for particular Galileo system clock features. Regarding the clock estimation technique the OD&TS (Orbit Determination and Time Synchronization) E-OSPF SW module implements an algorithm that allows the existence of a backup time reference to be used in case of lack of observability from the master PTF (Precise Timing Facility). This is particularly useful in the IOV (In-Orbit Validation) configurations which will allow the verification of the proper functioning of the overall system before entering the FOC (Full Operation Capability) phase. The clock prediction fitting strategy currently implemented in the E-OSPF SW consists of estimating the zero-order clock prediction parameter with a reduced set of clock offsets containing the final epochs in the estimation arc whereas the first-order clock prediction parameter is computed by fitting the clock offsets in a larger time period typically as long as the estimation period. This strategy has been demonstrated to be successful with GPS data and is now being tested for real and simulated Galileo data as well.,2007

2007papers/paper1.pdf,TECHNICAL STATUS OF THE GALILEO SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT Jörg H. Hahn Galileo Project Office European Space Agency/ESTEC Noordwijk The Netherlands E-mail: joerg.hahn@esa.int Abstract,The development of the Galileo System continues under the partnership of the European Commission and the European Space Agency. ESA is charged with the development of the elements of the “Global Component ” which will be comprised of the complete constellation of satellites together with the ground segment. The ESA development will culminate in the establishment of an In Orbit Validation (IOV) milestone which will contain a minimum number of each element of the Full Operational Configuration (FOC). An overview of the Galileo services and requirements is provided. We briefly outline the architecture of the Galileo Global Component. We also introduce the overall development approach and risk mitigation activities such as GSTB-V1/V2 and GIOVE-A/B/M. The interoperability aspects (i.e. GGTO) are highlighted as well. The present master working schedule is presented.,2007
2007papers/paper16.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy since 1830 and in cooperation with other institutions has also provided timing for the United,States and the international community. Its Master Clock (MC) is the source of UTC (USNO) USNO’s realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which has stayed within 5 ns rms of UTC since 1999 and within 2.7 ns rms in 2007. The data used to generate UTC (USNO) are based upon 70 cesium and 24 hydrogen maser frequency standards in three buildings at two sites. USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem LORAN Network Time Protocol (NTP) GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). This paper describes some of the changes being made to meet the future needs for precision accuracy and robustness. Further details and explanations of our services can be found online at http://tycho.usno.navy.mil . I. TIME GENERATION The most important part of USNO’s Time Service Department is its staff which currently consists of 27 positions. Of these the largest group almost half the staff is directly involved in time transfer. The rest are fairly evenly divided between those who service the clocks those who monitor them and those who are working to develop new ones. The core stability of USNO time is based upon the clock ensemble. We currently have 69 HP5071 cesium clocks made by Hewlett-Packard/Agilent/Symmetricom 4 cesium CsIII-EP clocks made by Datum/Symmetricom and 24 cavity-tuned “Sigma-Tau/Datum/Symmetricom” hydrogen maser clocks which are located in two Washington D.C. buildings and at the USNO,2007

2007papers/paper28.pdf,ABSOLUTE CALIBRATION OF TIME RECEIVERS WITH DLR'S GPS/GALILEO HW SIMULATOR S. Thölert U. Grunert H. Denks and J. Furthner German Aerospace Centre (DLR) Institute of Communications and Navigation Oberpfaffenhofen Germany Phone: +49 (8153) 28-2320 Fax: +49 (8153) 28-2328 Email: steffen.thoelert@dlr.de Abstract,A usual way for time transfer between atomic clocks operated at different locations is the use of the well known GNSS Common View technique. This technique is based on time receivers measuring the time differences between the connected atomic clock and the GNSS satellite clocks. The results obtained can be used for time scale generation such as UTC or TAI. In order to produce a very accurate time scale from all time differences measured with different GNSS time receivers the accurate calibration of them is essential. In recent years two main methods for time receiver calibration have been proposed. One is to compare the obtained time differences relative to a calibrated receiver. In the second method one performs an absolute calibration of time receivers using a GPS HW simulator. In this paper the absolute calibration of time receivers with DLR’s GPS/Galileo HW simulator is analyzed and described in detail. The primary step is to calibrate the simulator itself. In this context the most important facts and values that have to be measured are explained. After the calibration of the simulator the receiver is fed with satellite signals generated by the simulator belonging to a standard GPS satellite constellation in order to determine the absolute offset of the receiver (internal delay) compared to the simulator output. Additionally the precision of a combined GPS/Galileo receiver for frequency transfer is investigated and determined.,2007
2007papers/paper3.pdf,ABOUT COMPASS TIME AND ITS COORDINATION WITH OTHER GNSSs Shaowu Dong Xiaohui Li and Haitao Wu National Time Service Center Chinese Academy of Sciences 3 East Shuyuan Road Lintong District Xi’an Shaanxi 710600 Peoples Republic of China Fax: +29 83890196; E-mail: dongsw@ntsc.ac.cn Abstract,Compass is the global satellite navigation system of China which is in the process of construction. The first test satellite was lunched on 17 April 2007. As timekeeping infrastructure is the most important part for a GNSS system the traceability of Compass system time (named BDT) and its coordination with other GNSSs are discussed as is the possible link from Compass time to national standard time. The National Time Service Centre (NTSC) will most probably act as the backup timing center of the Compass system through which Compass time can finally be traced to UTC. Offering the time offset between Compass time and other GNSS systems is considered in order to facilitate the user’s need for interoperability. A prospective technique for coordinating Compass with other GNSSs and suggestions on promoting international cooperation are proposed.,2007

Moscow 111250 Russia Tel: + 7 495 673 97 29 Fax: +7 495 673 28 15 E-mail: sergey.karutin@rniikp.ru Abstract The Russian GLObal NAvigation Satellite System (GLONASS) has been put into operation,in the early 90s of the last century. It passed a difficult time and has been recovering now. The main aspects of GLONASS’s development process are presented in this article including the current status and international cooperation aspects. There is no doubt that satellite navigation has become an essential part of our day-by-day life. We have already learned the advantages of using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) while driving to an unknown place. You could use GNSS equipment without even noticing it. Today transportation energy communication agriculture etc. rely on and have been continuing to introduce GNSS solutions. GNSS systems like GLONASS or the American GPS were created to supply military applications but they have provided a civil service since the beginning and this service is dominating and playing a critical role for economic growth now. Based on this the Russian government defined the following state policy principles: − GLONASS is a strategic element of national security and economic development − GLONASS is a dual-use system − No direct user fees for the civil GLONASS service − Open access to the GLONASS civil signal structure for user equipment manufacture applications development and value-added services,2007

Chung and Paul MacNeal Jet Propulsion Lab California Institute of Technology Pasadena CA 91109-8099 USA E-mail: John.D.Prestage@jpl.nasa.gov Abstract We review progress in developing a small Hg ion clock for space operation based,on a breadboard ion-clock physics package where Hg ions are shuttled between a quadrupole and a 16-pole rf trap. With this architecture we have demonstrated a short-term stability ~ 1-2×10 -13 at 1 second averaging to 10 -15 at 1 day. This development shows that H-maser quality stabilities can be produced in a small clock package comparable in size to an ultra-stable quartz oscillator required for holding 1- 2×10 -13 at 1 second. We have completed an ion clock physics package designed to withstand vibration of launch and are currently building a ~ 1 kg engineering model for test. We also discuss frequency steering software algorithms that simultaneously measure ion signal size and lamp light output useful for long-term operation and self- optimization of microwave power and return engineering data.,2007
2007papers/paper19.pdf,COMBINATION OF GPS PPP AND TWO-WAY TIME TRANSFER FOR TAI COMPUTATION Z. Jiang and G. Petit Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) Pavillon de Breteuil F-92312 Sèvres Cedex Fax: 33 1 45077059 Tel: 33 1 45077034 E-mail: zjiang@bipm.org Abstract To follow the CCTF 2006 recommendation of using high-precision GPS carrier-phase data (CP) for TAI generation BIPM computes monthly the GPS PPP (Precise Point,Positioning) time links and publishes the result on the TAI ftp site. The GPS PPP is a combined solution of the codes and CP information. The latter assigns the high precision to the PPP result. It is shown that the PPP links have a better time stability than the TW ones in short and middle terms (up to a week). On the other hand TW could be more stable on the long term due to its symmetric measurement procedure and its more accurate absolute calibration. The combination of PPP and TW may benefit the advantages of both links. Because the GPS and TW are completely independent techniques combination of them makes the results less noisy less biased and more robust. The combination gives also a possibility to analyze the errors presented in each technique. One of them is the diurnal deviation in some TW KU band links. In this paper we first briefly review the recent study on the uncertainties of PPP and TW then quickly recall the model used for the combination and finally evaluate of the method proposed using measuring data. The TAI time network is highly redundant. This approach gives a new idea about fully using the potential of the two fundamental time transfer techniques: GPS and TW. 1.,2007

2007papers/opening.pdf,PTTI OPENING ADDRESS Captain Steve Warren Superintendent U.S. Naval Observatory,Ladies and Gentlemen: Meeting this morning. This series of PTTI meetings has continued to serve the timing community for nearly 40 years providing the chance for precise time and frequency users to demonstrate their ideas and present their requirements for improving the Defense Department’s ability to meet the nation's security needs. Similarly these conferences have allowed the providers of time and time interval the opportunity to make system developers aware of the latest improvements in the field and those that are likely to be in line for future operations. The objectives of the series of meetings namely to disseminate and coordinate PTTI information at the user level to review present and future PTTI requirements to inform civil and DoD engineers technicians and managers of advances in precise time and frequency technology and to provide an opportunity for an active exchange of new technology associated with PTTI are as important today as ever. Sessions at this meeting are devoted to the most recent developments at time and frequency standards laboratories as well as topics that promise significant developments in the future. These include advanced clocks clock modeling and simulation algorithms and methods time and frequency transfer techniques measurement technology timing systems and applications military applications and satellite navigation. Those items cover the PTTI field. And this year we have added a student poster competition. We are reminded frequently of the growing importance of satellite navigation in everyday life today. Precise timing provides the heart of these systems and the nearly routine use of GPS around the globe underscores the need to provide precise PTTI information not only to enable today’s routine uses but to ensure that positioning and navigation information becomes available in all environments including the,2007
2007papers/poster12.pdf,A SUMMARY OF THE GPS CONSTELLATION CLOCK PERFORMANCE Jay Oaks U.S. Naval Research Laboratory James A. Buisson Antoine Enterprises Inc. Marie M. Largay SFA Inc. Abstract,The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) conducts comprehensive analyses of the Global Po- sitioning System (GPS) atomic frequency standards under the sponsorship of the 2nd Space Operations Squadron (2SOPS) at the Master Control Station (MCS) in Colorado Springs Colo- rado. The analysis is based on clock estimates that NRL computes from GPS monitor station carrier-derived pseudo-range measurements and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) computed precise post-fit orbit ephemerides. The purpose of the analyses is to determine the performance of the timing signals originating from the atomic frequency standards onboard the space vehicles. Metrics used in the analyses include frequency drift stability profiles and stability histories based on the Allan and Hadamard variances. The relative performance of the space vehicle clocks is ranked and presented according to the clock types flown in GPS. An overview of the GPS constellation with respect to the lifetimes of space vehicles and space ve- hicle clocks both active and deactivated is also presented.,2007

This paper will discuss some of the key integrity monitoring parameters in the context of the GPS Block IIR TKS. The paper will also show that: (1) the phase meter output comparing the phase difference of the Rb Atomic Frequency Standard (AFS) and the VCXO in a 1.5-second GPS epoch behaves like a Gaussian distribution; (2) The TKS probability of false alarm is almost equal to zero due to its rather large detection threshold; (3) The TKS can detect and compensate for “large” VCXO frequency steps with no significant TKS output phase error; (4) The TKS cannot compensate “large” VCXO frequency drift steps and may require a MCS (Master Control Station) contingency upload to remove phase bias; (5) The TKS cannot detect “large” AFS frequency steps or frequency drift steps that cause the TKS output phase error to run away but steps of that type have not be observed in IIR operation so far.,2007
2007papers/paper36.pdf,ENSEMBLE TIME IN GNSS - PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND ALGORITHM TESTS M. Suess A. Moudrak and E. Frolova {Matthias.Suess Alexandre.Moudrak}@dlr.de German Aerospace Center (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen Germany Abstract Any Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) relies on a highly stable and reliable System,Time that has to meet high-performance requirements to enable GNSS services suitable for navigation and timing communities. The challenge is to guarantee this high performance continuously. The Kalman filter algorithm implemented in GPS called the GPS Composite Clock is a mature method to generate such a highly robust System Time. The algorithm estimates the time offsets of every individual clock to the so-called implicit mean which is a common component in all clock estimates. The common component offers the functionality of System Time and is understandable as a weighted average out of all ensemble clock readings. GPS Composite Clock performance is analyzed by simulations of a “light” GNSS configuration with 10 rubidium satellite clocks including deterministic drift six ground cesium clocks and two ground active hydrogen masers. Besides evaluating the stability of an error-free clock constellation to define the regular performances the behavior of the algorithm is investigated considering different operational scenarios: exclusion of clocks from the GNSS ensemble and occurrence of clock feared events (frequency steps in rubidium satellite clocks and ground H- masers).,2007

I have found a dominant common component for 3-state clock Kalman filter phase errors with the curvature of a nonlinear low-order polynomial that does not exist for 2-state clocks. Cesium clocks are free of frequency-drift but rubidium and hydrogen-maser clocks have significant frequency drift. Use of the 3-state clock model and an understanding of its true and estimated behavior will facilitate operation of the associated composite clock.,2007

2007papers/paper46.pdf,IMPROVING GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE GPS POSITIONING ERROR USING DYNAMIC TWO-WAY TIME TRANSFER MEASUREMENTS Capt. Benjamin Dainty John Raquet and Capt. Richard Beckman Advanced Navigation Technology (ANT) Center Air Force Institute of Technology AFIT/ENG 2950 Hobson Way Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433 USA E-mail: John.Raquet@afit.edu Abstract,GPS signals can be used for positioning satellites in geostationary (GEO) orbits but the performance in this case is poor because very few pseudorange measurements are available at any given time. This paper describes a new method for improving geostationary satellite navigation accuracy by using dynamic Two-Way Time Transfer (TWTT) measurements. By directly measuring the clock error between the GPS satellite and the GPS receiver TWTT allows meaningful information to be gathered when less than four GPS satellites are available. A simulation was developed in which satellites in GEO orbits with GPS receivers onboard generated a position with 1) GPS with a crystal clock 2) GPS with an onboard atomic clock 3) GPS with TWTT to a ground-based atomic clock and 4) GPS with TWTT to a ground-based clock synchronized to GPS time. Bringing an atomic clock into the system (Cases 2 and 3) resulted in a 21-38% improvement in the 3-D RMS position accuracy over the standard GPS case (Case 1). However using TWTT with a clocked slaved to GPS time resulted in a 60%-70% improvement in 3-D RMS positioning accuracy. This level of performance was obtained for TWTT measurement error standard deviations anywhere between 0.3 ns to 30 ns.,2007
2007papers/paper50.pdf,HOW EXTRACTING INFORMATION FROM DATA HIGHPASS FILTERS ITS ADDITIVE NOISE Victor S. Reinhardt Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems El Segundo CA USA Abstract This paper examines the characteristics of three types of random error measures in the presence of negative power law (neg-p) noise: (a) the observable residual error after removing an estimate of an information containing causal function from data (b) the jitter the residual,error with additional highpass (HP) filtering and (c) M th -order difference ( Δ ) variances such as the Allan variance (1 st -order Δ -variance of the fractional frequency error y(t)) and the Hadamard-Picinbono variance (2 nd -order Δ -variance of y(t)). Measures (b) and (c) are used to mitigate perceived divergence problems in the mean square (MS) of Measure (a) due to the presence of neg-p noise. This paper proves that this perception is wrong; it shows that the MS of Measure (a) converges in the presence of neg-p noise by demonstrating that extracting a statistically optimal estimate of the causal behavior from data HP filters the noise in the measure. It is further shown that the order of this noise HP filtering increases with the,2007
2007papers/poster7.pdf,INFLUENCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON A RUBIDIUM CLOCK’S FREQUENCY AGING James Camparo and Charles Klimcak The Aerospace Corporation Mail Stop: M2-253 PO Box 92957 Los Angeles CA 90009 USA E-mail: james.c.camparo@aero.org Abstract A number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of frequency,aging in the rubidium atomic clock. Helium permeation is one such mechanism. Briefly the four millitorr of helium in the Earth’s atmosphere can permeate into the resonance cell changing the clock frequency via the pressure shift of the 0-0 hyperfine transition. On orbit any He in the resonance cell would permeate out again changing the buffer gas pressure in the resonance cell. Unfortunately studies examining this hypothesis have not been particularly clear cut. Here we report on a multi-year study comparing the frequency aging rates of three Rb clocks in vacuum and in air. Our findings indicate that the atmosphere does play a role in frequency aging at least for one family of Rb clocks and adds evidence to the helium permeation hypothesis. However when combined with on-orbit data it appears that frequency aging in vapor-cell clocks is likely driven by more than one mechanism.,2007
2007papers/poster6.pdf,PROSPECTS FOR ULTRA-STABLE TIMEKEEPING WITH SEALED VACUUM OPERATION IN MULTI-POLE LINEAR ION TRAP STANDARDS E. A. Burt and R. L. Tjoelker Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology Pasadena CA 91109-8099 USA E-mail: eric.a.burt@jpl.nasa.gov Abstract,A recent long-term comparison between the compensated multi-pole Linear Ion Trap Standard (LITS) and the laser-cooled primary standards via GPS carrier-phase time transfer showed a deviation of less than 2.7×10 -17 /day. A subsequent evaluation of potential drift contributors in the LITS showed that the leading candidates are fluctuations in background gases and the neon buffer gas. The current vacuum system employs a “flow-through” turbo- molecular pump and a diaphragm fore-pump. Here we consider the viability of a “sealed” vacuum system pumped by a non-evaporable getter for long-term ultra-stable clock operation. Initial tests suggest that both further stability improvement and longer mean-time-between- maintenance can be achieved using this approach.,2007

At NICT we developed Time Comparison Equipment (TCE) both onboard ETS-VIII and in the Earth station for precise time transfer between the atomic clocks on the satellite and a ground reference clock. Using code and carrier-phase data measured by TCE the time and frequency difference between the onboard atomic clock and that on the ground is calculated by the Two-Way Satellite Ground Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSGTFT) method. Since February 2007 we have carried out the experiment to confirm the performance of TCE in orbit after the launch. As a result we confirmed that TCE is able to measure the code phase with subnanosecond precision and measure the carrier phase with a few-picosecond precision.,2007

2003papers/paper29b.pdf,ITU-R SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR GROUP ON THE FUTURE OF THE UTC TIME SCALE Ron Beard SRG Chairman U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Washington D.C. 20375 USA Abstract,As a result of issues raised by sector members of the ITU-R (International Telecommunication Union - Radiocommunications) and a letter from the Director of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) to the Secretary General of the ITU a new question ITU-R 236/7 (2000) “The Future of the UTC Timescale ” was generated by ITU-R Study Group 7 (Science Services) Working Party 7A (Standard Frequency and Time Signal Services). The question considers the definition and future use of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) in the ITU-R Recommendations. A major change to the UTC timescale as defined in the current recommendations could have a potentially significant impact on broadcast time and frequency services synchronization of communications networks navigation systems and time distribution performance. Accordingly Study Group 7 Working Party 7A has established a Special Rapporteur Group (SRG) to specifically address the question of the future of the UTC timescale the associated leap second and related issues. The SRG has held coordination and technical exchange meetings to gather pertinent data and discuss alternative approaches to the issues. The result of these efforts had not produced sufficient information for analysis of alternatives nor produced a clearly defined course of action. However the SRG wanted to present results and discuss viable alternatives with representative parties that had come forth as a result of these activities. For that purpose the SRG organized a Special Colloquium for deliberating and reporting on these issues to the ITU-R. THE UTC TIME SCALE UTC is defined by in the International Telecommunication Union - Radiocommunications (ITU-R) recommendations as the basis for standard frequency and time signal emissions. These standard frequencies and time signals are the foundation of frequency generation and regulating broadcasting for,2003

2003papers/paper7.pdf,INITIAL TESTING OF A NEW GPS RECEIVER THE POLARX2 FOR TIME AND FREQUENCY TRANSFER USING DUAL- FREQUENCY CODES AND CARRIER PHASES P. Defraigne C. Bruyninx and F. Roosbeek Royal Observatory of Belgium Abstract To contribute to TAI the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB) routinely performs all-in-,view time transfer using an Ashtech Z-XII3T GPS receiver and the in-house-developed RINEX- CGGTTS conversion software. In order to anticipate the renewal of that kind of time transfer equipment the ROB started to test a new geodetic GPS receiver the PolaRx2 developed by Septentrio (Belgium) for suitability for time transfer applications. Our results obtained using codes as well as carrier phases show that this receiver is very promising with a 1 pps input port and a very low noise level on the codes. However we proposed and started to evaluate some hardware and firmware adaptations to improve its performances for continuous and precise (sub-ns) time transfer. The present firmware release indeed introduces clock discontinuities at each receiver reset and produces variations at the level of tenths of nanosecond due to internal temperature variations related to changes in the processor load (depending on the number of used channels).,2003

The term “distributed coherent RF operations” is defined and classes of military operations are identified. The precision required for various parameters and basic phenomenology of different types of errors are discussed by way of simple examples.

2003papers/paper12.pdf,COMMON-VIEW LORAN-C AS A BACKUP TO GPS FOR PRECISE TIME RECOVERY Tom Celano Timing Solutions Corporation LT Kevin Carroll USCG Loran Support Unit Casey Biggs Timing Solutions Corporation and Michael Lombardi NIST Abstract The LORAN-C network is being recapitalized to serve as a backup to GPS for navigation,and timing. LORAN-C is being investigated as a precision (sub 100 ns) time recovery system for use in the continental United States. Traditionally LORAN-C time recovery has been limited by propagation effects (both spatial and temporal) to provide time recovery in the microsecond range. By employing common-view techniques long used in GPS the potential exists to enhance time recovery performance by over an order of magnitude using LORAN-C. The LORAN-C Accuracy Panel (run by the US Coast Guard) has sponsored a research project to collect data and determine the performance level for time recovery using common-view LORAN-C. This paper presents the results of that work. This paper begins with a short overview of the LORAN-C recapitalization project with an emphasis on timing enhancements at the transmitting stations. A description of the common- view LORAN-C test network follows. Data collected in Boulder will be corrected via common- view using a near field station and a far field station. Results will be analyzed to determine the dependence of time recovery precision on distance. 1.0,2003

2003papers/wgC.pdf,WORKING GROUP C: CALIBRATION ISSUES SUMMARY OF THE DISCUSSION Jay Oaks U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and Edoardo Detoma SEPA S. p. A.,Torino Italy ISSUES DISCUSSED The attendees were first presented with an initial set of issues and several specific questions that related to these issues. The first issue was systems of interest. The primary interests were in GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer (TWSTFT). Two methods of calibration absolute and relative were identified and examples of each were discussed. The limiting factors that affect calibrations in- cluded the instrumentation cables environment and stability. The importance of the verification of a calibration through a time transfer closure to a truth source or agreement with an additional independent measurement was discussed. Last some consideration was given to what future improvements would affect calibration capabilities. CALIBRATION METHODS Two calibration methods were discussed absolute and relative. In an absolute calibration the delays in the time transfer instrumentation are discretely measured with the accuracy intrinsic to the calibration equipment or measurement. In a relative calibration a reference time transfer system is used side-by-side with the subject system to perform measurement comparisons between the two systems. Considerations when performing either type of calibration include maintaining conditions identical to the normal operat- ing conditions of the equipment to be calibrated. Frequency signal level and environment are some of the factors. In the absolute calibration method a test signal generator is used to inject a reference signal into the equipment to be calibrated. The generation of this reference signal must be as accurate as the desired result of the calibration. Also the reference signal must be consistent a provide repeatability in,2003

2003papers/paper3.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U. S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy and the Department,of Defense since 1830 and in cooperation with other institutions has also provided timing for the United States and the international community. Its Master Clock is the source of UTC (USNO) which has stayed within 5 ns of UTC in the past year with an RMS deviation of 3 ns. The data used to generate UTC (USNO) are based upon 73 HP5071 cesium and 18 hydrogen maser frequency standards in three buildings at two sites. The USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem LORAN Network Time Protocol GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer. The USNO would not be able to meet all the requirements of its users had it kept to the same technology it had 10 years ago; this paper will describe some of the changes being made to meet the anticipated needs of our users. While we aim to increase our accuracy and precision we deem it equally important to bring about robustness and we recommend this for our users as well. Further details and explanations of our services can be found online at http://tycho.usno.navy.mil or by contacting the author directly. I. RAW TIME The most important part of the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) Time Service Department is its staff which currently consists of 26 employees. Of these the largest group about half the staff is directly involved in time transfer. The rest are fairly evenly divided between those who service the clocks those who monitor them and those who are trying to develop new ones. The core stability of USNO time is based upon our clock ensemble. We currently have 73 HP5071 cesium clocks and 18 cavity-tuned “Sigma-Tau/Datum/Symmetricom” hydrogen maser clocks which are located in two Washington D.C. buildings and also at the USNO Alternate Master Clock (AMC) located,2003
2003papers/wgA.pdf,WORKING GROUP A: THE FUTURE OF UTC SUMMARY OF THE DISCUSSION Judah Levine Time and Frequency Division National Institute of Standards and Technology Boulder CO 80305 USA Sam Stein and Tom Celano,Timing Solutions Corporation Boulder CO 80301 USA The discussion was introduced by Judah Levine who presented background information on how Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) is computed at present: a. UTC is derived from International Atomic Time (TAI) which is computed by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) using a weighted average of the times of an ensemble of about 200 cesium clocks and hydrogen masers that are located at various National Metrology Institutes and Timing Laboratories. The frequency of TAI is steered from time to time using data from a number of primary frequency standards. The frequency of UTC is identical to that of TAI except during a leap second. b. The time of UTC is maintained within ± 0.9 s of UT1 a time scale based on the rotation of the Earth and additional integer “leap” seconds are added to UTC to maintain this relationship. Although both positive and negative leap seconds are defined by the standard only positive leap seconds have ever been used since the length of the UTC day is systematically too short relative to UT1. A leap second is announced in advance by the International Earth Rotation Service and is inserted into UTC as the last second of the last day of a month. The last minute of the day is 61 seconds long when a positive leap second is inserted and the name of the extra leap second is 23:59:60. Leap seconds have always been inserted at the ends of June or December but other months might also be used in principle. c. Although a leap second has not been required since the end of 1999 the long-term average interval,2003

2003papers/paper29.pdf,A NEW REALIZATION OF TERRESTRIAL TIME G. Petit BIPM Pavillon de Breteuil 92312 Sèvres Cedex France E-mail: gpetit @ bipm.org Abstract,Terrestrial Time TT is a time coordinate in a geocentric reference system. It is realized through International Atomic Time TAI which gets its stability from some 200 atomic clocks worldwide and its accuracy from a small number of primary frequency standards (PFSs) whose frequency measurements are used to steer the TAI frequency. Because TAI is computed in “real time” and has operational constraints it does not provide an optimal realization of TT. The BIPM therefore computes another realization TT (BIPM) in postprocessing which is based on a weighted average of the evaluations of TAI frequency by the PFSs. The procedures to process PFS data have been recently updated and we consequently propose an updated computation of TT (BIPM). We use all recently available data from new Cs fountain PFS and a revised estimation of the stability of the free-running atomic time scale EAL on which TAI is based. The performance of the new realization of TT is discussed and is used to assess the accuracy of recent PFS measurements.,2003

2003papers/paper24.pdf,THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN SOME STATE SPACE AND FIR ALGORITHMS IN GPS-BASED OPTIMAL CONTROL OF A LOCAL CRYSTAL CLOCK Y. S. Shmaliy R. Olivera-Reyna O. Ibarra-Manzano and R. Olivera-Reyna Electronics Dept. FIMEE Guanajuato University Salamanca 36730 Mexico E-mail: shmaliy@salamanca.ugto.mx Abstract,The report 1 addresses a numerical investigation of the trade-off between some state space and FIR filtering algorithms intended to provide optimal time error steering of a local crystal clock employing the GPS reference time. For the sake of low-cost crystal clocks we employ four most simple structures namely 1) Two-state Kalman 2) Three-state Kalman 3) FIR with the constant kernel (simple MA) and 4) FIR with the linear kernel (optimally unbiased for lin- ear phase drift). The optimal control problem is numerically solved in a sense of least mean squares for the GPS-based time error database and for different estimators tuned to have the same time constant. We study a digital control loop of a local clock assuming the latter to be linear and inertialess with respect to the filter memory. We also compare the algorithms for the mean square error produced and for sensitivity to variations of the feedback coefficient.,2003

2003papers/poster10.pdf,COMPARING CODE DATA FROM CARRIER-PHASE GPS RECEIVERS TO OTHER TIME TRANSFER METHODS AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY H. Chadsey Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Abstract There has been considerable interest in recent years concerning the use of pseudorange data,from RINEX files to perform time transfer. The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has been actively involved in developing this technology as an alternative time transfer method between its Washington DC and Colorado Springs CO sites. This paper compares the time solutions derived from the IGS RINEX files to Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). It will also show the IGS data when converted to Common GPS GLONASS Time Transfer Standard (CGGTTS) format can be useful in detecting problems and act as an additional verification tool when time transfer operations appear to be normal.,2003
2003papers/poster11.pdf,EXTENDING THE TRACKING SCHEDULE OF A SINGLE-CHANNEL GPS TIME RECEIVER J. Palacio F. J. Galindo and J. A. Lima Real Observatorio de la Armada Spain Abstract There are now available four types of navigation satellites suitable for time and frequency transfer: GPS GLONASS WAAS and EGNOS. This paper describes a new time transfer system TTS-3 based on a Javad Legacy receiver allowing observations of these satellites,simultaneously in multi-channel and multi-frequency mode. The following codes are used: C/A code for GPS WAAS EGNOS and GLONASS; P-code for GLONASS; and reconstructed P- code for GPS. Receiver hardware treatment of observations and output data fulfill the recommendations of the CCTF Group on GNSS Time Transfer Standards (CGGTTS). The structure of the new time transfer unit is described in brief and the results of some multi-system time transfer tests are presented. WHY? • Our NBS-type receiver can store 48 tracks data in memory. The BIPM schedule is limited by this number. • Consequently it can only perform 48 over 90 possible 13 minutes tracks per day. It is resting 47% of the day. • When power recycled it can store only the last 19 tracks data in backup memory. This is only 40% of a complete day’s tracks. PREVIOUS WORK • Real Observatorio de la Armada (ROA) has developed its own source code to: – download GPS data automatically and periodically – Upload the BIPM official tracking schedule a few minutes before 00:00 UTC of the changing date. • If we are able to establish a continuous dialog with the GPS why not increase the number of tracks per day extending the tracking schedule by changing the content of the memory registers?

Local generation and distribution of precise time and frequency reference signals comprise an essential and central component of each complex. Within each complex synchronized timing references are required by approximately 100 users located at distances up to 30 kilometers from the central control center and station Master Clock. In this paper a highly modular hot-swappable and expandable system design for generation delivery and synchronization of highly precise and stable timing signals over fiber-optic cables is described.,2003

The former is mathematically related to the latter by the conversion between time and frequency domain. In this paper the biases of the Fast Fourier transform (FFT) spectral estimate with Hanning window are checked and the resulting unbiased spectral density are used to calculate the Allan variance. Both the numerical integral and the curve-fitting methods are presented to calculate the variances. The numerical integral is a straightforward method to use and we can get the integral approximation after eliminating some spike points from SDF e.g. noise caused by ac power. In addition a common model for SDF is linear combinations of power- law processes which are distinguished by the integer powers in their functional dependence on Fourier frequency with the appropriate coefficients. Fitting a form of the above model to the resulting SDF using standard regression techniques can estimate these coefficients. Cutler’s formula is adopted to calculate the integral approximation using these coefficients. The approximations of variances from these,2003
2003papers/opening.pdf,OPENING REMARKS Dr. Kenneth J. Johnston Scientific Director U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA JAY OAKS (U.S. Naval Research Laboratory):,Welcome to the 35 th Interval (PTTI) Systems and Applications Meeting. It is my privilege to start the meeting. We have this morning an old friend who used to work at NRL the Scientific Director of the Naval Observatory Dr. Ken Johnston to give the opening remarks. KEN JOHNSTON: Good morning. I am very happy that Jay didn’t tell you stories on me; Jay and I have been associated for the last 30 years or so. He didn’t tell you about any of my trials and tribulations in time transfer. I am not going to get to that story either but we both think the other person did it and you can talk to us at the cocktail party about how we transferred time at the nanosecond level after the other person knew the other one’s answer. It is always good to know the answer to a complex problem. I am pleased to make the opening remarks for the 35 th Annual PTTI Systems and Applications Meeting. Capt. Gillard our Superintendent of the Naval Observatory expresses his regrets for not being able to attend the meeting. My presentation uses much of the material he prepared for the meeting. I modified this presentation and allowed Dr. Dennis McCarthy the Director of the Time Directorate at the USNO to review it. He removed most of my excellent material. So this presentation is about 75% Capt. Gillard and 25% Dr. Johnston. In fact when I saw Dr. McCarthy this morning he said that the whole presentation is questionable. That gives one a lot of confidence in opening the meeting.,2003

This paper presents a basic introduction to wavelets and wavelet analysis. We also look,briefly at some specific uses for wavelets with PTTI data including (1) tracking data whose statistical properties are evolving over time (2) decomposing the sample variance for a set of data into components that are attributable to variations over different scales and (3) decorrelating highly correlated data.,2003
2003papers/paper35.pdf,THE STATE OF THE ART IN AMATEUR TIMEKEEPING Tom Van Baak Seattle Washington USA E-mail: tvb@LeapSecond.com www.LeapSecond.com Abstract,One might assume precise time metrology is the exclusive domain of national scientific laboratories military infrastructure or professional calibration centers. But there are a number of amateurs who in recent years have built home timing labs purely as a hobby the performance of which now rivals that of some national labs. An even larger number of individuals perhaps hundreds own atomic standards and use them to satisfy or fuel their curiosity about the world of ultra-precise timekeeping. The following paper describes an extreme case of one home timing lab. First its motivation and history: from a pair of wrist watches 30 years ago accurate to seconds per week to a pair of active hydrogen masers today stable to parts in ten to the 15 th . Second its accomplishments: in the form of Web-published experiments including stability analysis of TCXO and OCXO stability comparison of 12 GPS-disciplined oscillators probing the cesium hyperfine clock transition hydrogen maser auto-tuning results GPS performance with and without selective availability homemade software tools and PC-based instrumentation systems. Finally the paper describes the technical challenges that a home timing lab faces many of which are the same challenges as a national timing laboratory though on a smaller scale. Solutions to such problems as budget power temperature space redundancy time transfer security computer logging and networking and automated operation are discussed.,2003
2003papers/poster15.pdf,APPLICATION OF CONTROL THEORY IN THE FORMATION OF A TIMESCALE P. Koppang D. Johns and J. Skinner U.S. Naval Observatory Abstract We have created a timescale that joins the short-term stability of several hydrogen masers with the long-term capabilities of an ensemble of cesium frequency standards. Control theory is utilized in a system design that combines frequency standards with varied properties. The,system steers a maser ensemble with respect to a cesium ensemble while minimally perturbing the maser short-term performance. Results are given from both simulated and measured data. Systems are designed using linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) and pole-placement techniques.,2003

2003papers/paper20.pdf,TIME DISSEMINATION AND COMMON VIEW TIME TRANSFER WITH GALILEO: HOW ACCURATE WILL IT BE? J. Furthner A. Moudrak A. Konovaltsev J. Hammesfahr and H. Denks Institute of Communications and Navigation German Aerospace Center (DLR) Abstract The future European navigation system Galileo will provide both positioning and timing,capabilities to its users in the frame of four basic navigation services. Two of them are of special interest: the Safety-of-Life (SoL) Service that will be associated with certain performance guarantees and the Open Service that will be provided free of charge. In this paper we assess the average accuracy of user synchronization to the Galileo system time using a prospective Galileo error budget and simulations of the Galileo satellite constellation. These simulations also allowed us to transform the (guaranteed) positioning performance of Galileo’s SoL Service into the timing domain and thus to identify the guarantees for timing users of this service. For comparison purposes the timing accuracy of GPS – considering its actual and projected error budget – is shown. We also demonstrate the performance of four selected processing techniques – an optimally unbiased moving average an adaptive linear enhancer a Kalman filter and a smoother – applied to Galileo Common View data that were simulated with the help of DLR’s GNSS simulation tool NavSim.,2003

2003papers/paper41.pdf,INVESTIGATIONS OF VAPOR-CELL CLOCK EQUILIBRATION FOLLOWING INITIAL ACTIVATION: A PROGRESS REPORT S. Herbulock C. Klimcak A. Presser J. Milne and J. Camparo The Aerospace Corporation PO Box 92957 Los Angeles CA 90009 USA Abstract,Over the past several years anecdotal evidence has grown indicating that Rb gas-cell frequency standards exhibit a long “equilibration” period of somewhere between 30 and 70 days following their initial activation. The mechanism driving this behavior is not well understood and has been the subject of debate. Generally lamp intensity has also been observed to undergo a slow variation following the clock’s turn-on and since the clock’s resonant frequency depends on light intensity via the light-shift effect there has been speculation regarding the light-shift as a possible mechanism for long-term equilibration. However helium permeation has also been suggested as a contributing mechanism since the gas cells are manufactured free of He and over time atmospheric He must permeate into the cells changing the clock frequency via the pressure- shift effect. In order to characterize the nature and discern the mechanism of equilibration in Rb clocks we have initiated a project to study the long-term (i.e. > 100 days) deterministic variations of Rb clocks from different manufacturers. Though our preliminary data confirms the anecdotal findings the data at present are ambiguous regarding a causal relationship between long-term lamp-intensity change and clock-frequency change.,2003

2003papers/award.pdf,DISTINGUISHED PTTI SERVICE AWARD Presented to S. Clark Wardrip NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (Ret.) by Dr. Joseph D. White U.S. Naval Research Laboratory JOE WHITE:,Good morning. It is really nice to see a crowd like this at the meeting particularly this early on a Tuesday morning. So thank you all very much for being here. The next item on the agenda is the presentation of the Distinguished PTTI Service Award. That is one of the nice things I get to do just about every year: recognize someone in the community who we think has made a contribution to the field. The way we decide the award is actually over a broad range of things. Sometimes it is a distinguished scientist sometimes a person who has been involved in making things happen; all sorts of possibilities. This year I am very happy to announce our winner is going to be Clark Wardrip. I talked to Clark awhile back. Clark is head of the Advisory Board Committee among other things and one of the things that the Advisory Board does is usually pay the expenses of the awardee so that they do not have to pay their own way to the meeting. He called me up and said “Have you decided who the awardee is going to be? I would like to send him a check.” And I said “Clark send yourself the check and come on and show up at the meeting.” I also said “Clark you know one of the things traditionally here is that I will stand up here and list all your accomplishments and I have only known you 30 years or so. You have been in the business a lot longer than that and if you don’t send me something I will just talk to people and have them tell me what you did.” And he said “No no please don’t do that.” I mentioned Jim Buisson’s name – and it is not polite to roast your awardee anyway I don’t think. Clark sent me a few notes here I have about five pages I think. I will try to hit the highlights. Clark started his professional career at NRL – actually I think he started as a student while he was at Maryland. He stayed at NRL for about 10 years. He worked on things like CIC facilities satellite tracking systems radar tracking,2003

We had good participation. Obviously they did a lot of preparation before and follow-up afterwards. I want to thank all of you for participating. So this is the end. For those of you who have to catch airplanes we are about ready to go. We talked about the Working Groups a fair amount. They were very well attended a lot of people. Some fairly nice discussions. I was also really pleased this year that we had some good high-level input from the Department of Defense. I think we got a better feel for what the official thinking is there and where they think they are going. This is my list of the things I really liked and I realized as I was writing it that I liked everything. So I stopped after a while. But there were some nice things there. The chip-scale clock work as I said when I was talking about that earlier was very nice. A lot of real things of promise there. Probably the presentation I got the most comments about though was the amateur timekeeping thing. That is just truly amazing. I think that was really wonderful to see. We did something different this year with the national labs. Normally what they’ll do is present a whole 20- minute paper. This year we decided what we would do instead as you saw was to let them present a short presentation and then follow up with a poster session where they could talk to you individually what they’ve done what they wanted to do where things are going at their laboratories. We had a nice session on algorithms and methods. Don Percival if you are still here thank you very much. The future of UTC comes up again and again. As I say there were a lot of things that got done here.,2003

1992papers/paper24_30.pdf,SYNOPSIS OF TIMING MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES USED IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS George Zampetti Telecom Solutions Abstract,Historically Maximum Time Interval Ewor (MTIE) and Maximum ReMve Time Interval Error (MRTIE) have been the main measurement techniques used to characterize timing performance in telecommunicakions networks. Recently a new measurement technique Time Variance (WAR) has gained acceptance in the North American (ANSI) standards body. WAR was developed in concuwence wilh NIST to address certain inadequacies in the MTIE approach. This paper describes the advantages and disadvantages of each of these approaches. Real mensurement examples are presented to illustrate the critical issues in actual telecommunication applications. F i ~ u y a new MTIE measurement is proposed (ZTIE) thaf complements TVAR. Togefher WAR and ZTIE provide a very good characterization of network,1992

A fractional frequency synthesizer developed by SEPA has been incorporated in the Frequency Locked Loop of a TFL Rubidium Frequency Standard. This combination allows a tiequency settability in steps of 1.5.10-'~ (optional 1.10-'9 over a range of without having to resort to change the C-field to tune the output frequency of the device.

Future telecom- munications space tracking electronic intelligence metrology navigation and data acquisition will thereby be sewed including: I) On-board ephemeris determination 2) Reduced synchronization time for time division muUiple access (TDMA) links and 3) In-flight cbck calibration increasing on-board autonomy and reducing ground support costs. Manned space transportation through the first quarter of the 21 ""' century will probably depend on a mix of vehicles including the Advanced Manned Launch System (AMLS) the Personnel Launch System (PLS) and continued use of the Shuttle Fleet. Precise Ephemeris is important on-board for mission success status monitoring also for rendezvous and docking. Use of GPS can eliminate ground based trackinglprocessing enhancing autonomy and reducing communicatwns bandwidth.",1992

Cecil Naval Undersea Warfare Center Detachment AUTEC West Palm Beach FL 33402-7517 INTRODUCTION,The Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) is a U.S. Navy test range located on Andros Island Bahamas and a Division of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Newport RI. The Headquarters of AUTEC is located at a facility in West Palm Beach FL. AUTEC's primarily mission is to provide the U.S. Navy with a deepwater test and evaluation f cility for making underwater acoustic measurements testing and calibrating sonars and providing accurate underwater surface and in-air tracking data on surface ships submarines aircraft and weapon systems. Many of these programs are in support of Antisubmarine Warfare (ASW) un- dersea research and development programs and Fleet assessment and operational readiness trials. Most tests conducted at AUTEC require precise underwater tracking (plus or minus 3 yards) of multiple acoustic signals emitted with the correct waveshape and repetition criteria from either a surface craft or underwater vehicle. BACKGROUND At AUTEC there are two separate underwater tracking ranges located in the Tongue-of-the- Ocean (TOTO) and adjacent to Andros Island Bahama3. A combination of the narrow shore-,1992

Lower Weight: Many users felt that clocks primarily cesium clocks are too heavy. They expressed a willingness to trade some internal battery capacity for lower weight. Computer Control/Monitoring: Several users felt that direct connection between a clock and a computer would simplify their operations by automatic clock monitoring. There was also interest in using a compputer interface to control the clock. Outputs: In addition to the usual 1 5 and 10 Mhz outputs there was also interest in 100 MHz and 16 MHz. Fiber optic output was considered to be desirable in future desighns although some,1992

The moderator read the following submission from John Vig Army Research Laboratory: ""GPS is an outstanding navigation system and it is also an accurate source of precise time due to the presence of high quality atomic clocks on the GPS satel- lites. It makes good sense for military systems to take advantage of the precise timing ability of GPS 'however although GPS is not at risk today as more and more systems become dependent on this system GPS becomes a more and more attractive target for future adversaries.

2001papers/paper6.pdf,COMPARISON OF CONTINUOUSLY FILTERED TRANSFER WITH INDEPENDENT DAILY GPS GPS CARRIER-PHASE TIME AND FREQUENCY CARRIER-PHASE SOLUTIONS AND WITH TWO-WAY SATELLITE TIME TRANSFER Demetrios Matsakis Ken Senior and Phyllis Cook U.S. Naval Observatory Abstract Several different modes,of precise time transfer are currently in use or under development. These include GPS common view two-way satellite time transfer and GPS carrier phase. The U.S. Naval Observatory has accumulated several years of data analyzing these techniques with side-by-side comparisons over short intermediate and long baselines. Each technique can offer something to the mix and we use the comparisons to discuss the strong points and weaknesses of each one.,2001

2001papers/paper1.pdf,SPACE CLOCKS -WHY THEY'RE DIFFERENT Joe White and Ronald Beard U.S. Naval Research Laboratory Abstract,Atomic clocks for use in operational satellites such as GPS and MILSTAR are a breed apart from their terrestrial cousins. Like most space electronic packages clocks will seem to be a generation behind the technology used in other applications. The reasons for this include the need for high reliability parts radiation hardness and mechanical design. Other key drivers in the designs include zero gravity unattended operation limited monitoring bandwidth and limits on weight size and power. Clocks used in short-term space experiments can be closer in design to ground clocks but are generally not usable for operational systems without extensive rnod@cations.,2001

2001papers/opening.pdf,OPENING REMARKS Dr. Kenneth J. Johnston Scientific Director U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC,20392 USA Good morning. This talk is usually given by the Captain of the Naval Observatory so I have to give it in the obligatory way to introduce everyone to the program that we are going to have at the meeting today. This is the obligatory talk to remind everybody what the objective of the meeting is. (“PTTI”) meeting. My first duty is to remind you of the objectives of the PTTI meeting as promulgated in the brochure. The objectives have changed little since the fvst meeting. These are to bring uses of PTTI together to coordinate their activities review and present future requirements and to provide technical information to government engineers technicians managers and scientists. So this is what is in your brochure this is the objective of the meeting as we all know it very well. This meeting will address many important areas of PTTI. These areas have expanded since the first meeting as has the accuracy of PTTI. The report,2001

I think there is an old curse that says “May you live in interesting times ” and probably the last few months have been more interesting than most of us would have liked. I am certainly very pleased to see all of you here today and through this week. Some people asked what the attendance change was. I have it on a slide here but while I am waiting for them to put up the slide I will just tell you. Last year I think we ran around 175 and this year when we get everything all counted up we are probably close to 150. So,2001

Ball Aerospace Systems Division 3300,Mitchell Ln. P.O. Box 1062 Boulder CO 80301 Boulder CO 80306 Int reduction The problem of controlling the phase and frequency of atomic clocks is analyzed in two stages. The first step requires estimating the state (time and frequency) of the clock at the time of the last measurement and forecasting the future state. The second step is the design of a control algorithm for steering the slave clock to the reference. This division of the overall control problem is useful because different design requirements are utilized for each step. We apply the Kalman filter to perform optimum state estimation and forecasting. The Kalman filter is advantageous for this application because it provides minimum least squares error estimates and forecasts both during transients and for steady state operation. It also,1987

2012papers/PTTI2012.p91.pdf,91 Three Years of GLONASS Use for UTC Z. Jiang and W. Lewandowski Time Department Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) Pavillon de Breteuil F-92312 SÈVRES CEDEX France zjiang@bipm.org Abstract—GPS has been used in accurate time transfer for near 30 years. TWSTFT (Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer) has been applicable for the last 10 years. On the other hand the first GLONASS,satellite was launched in 1982 and became operational some years after. Although efforts have been made to use GLONASS since the 1990s only in November 2009 was the first GLONASS time link introduced in the generation of UTC. At present there are 6 GLONASS links contributing to UTC. This marked the start of the epoch of GNSS multi-technique time transfer in the history of UTC. In the frame of the UTC computation we investigate the evolution of the GLONASS measurements used in UTC and the calibration uncertainties in the accurate time transfer with respect to GPS and TWSTFT. We review the advantages and disadvantages of different techniques and the combination of the two systems. Key words: UTC Time transfer GLONASS GPS I. I NTRODUCTION The first GLONASS (GLN) satellite was launched in 1982 and the system became operational some years after. Efforts have being made since the 1990s to use GLONASS in accurate time transfers [1 2 3 4]. In 2005 the BIPM proposed an operational method to enable GLN used for the UTC generation [5]. In 2009 the international Consultative Committee for Time and Frequency (CCTF) recommended the use of multi- techniques in time transfer to ensure the precision the accuracy and the robustness in UTC. To complement the existing GPS and TWSTFT time links in November 2009 the first two GLONASS time links were introduced into the UTC world-wide time link network [6]. Since 2011 6 GLONASS time links are used in the UTC computation. These marked the epoch of GNSS multi-technique time transfer in the history of UTC.,2012

2010papers/peters memoriam.pdf,IN MEMORIAM HARRY PETERS Paul Koppang U.S. Naval Observatory,Many people in this community knew Harry Peters or have been associated with the hydrogen masers he designed and created in one way or another. Harry passed away this past May. Harry grew up in Minnesota and graduated from high school in 1941. He then joined the Navy and received an Honorable Discharge in 1953 with last rating as a Chief Petty Officer. He graduated magna cum laude from the University of Washington with a B.S. in Engineering Physics. After working 3 years at the Applied Physics Lab of Johns Hopkins he accepted a position with Bomack later Varian in Beverly Massachusetts. While there he participated in the design construction and operation of the first field-operable hydrogen masers with Bob Vessot and with the consultation of Norman Ramsey and Dan Kleppner. From 1965 to 1975 he was responsible for the hydrogen maser research and development at NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center for the VLBI network. The first masers Harry developed at Goddard were the NR-1 and the NR-2 (NASA Research) masers. In 1977 with wife Aileen Peters he incorporated Sigma Tau Standards Corporation where he undertook research to develop a small hydrogen maser for the Air Force. This research led to the development of the cavity-frequency switching method of cavity tuning that did not require an external frequency reference: an auto-turning maser. Also developed at Sigma Tau was an improved focusing magnet and beam trajectory design that reduced hydrogen consumption by more than an order of magnitude. In 1985 the first three Sigma Tau prototype masers that implemented these new designs were delivered. These designs evolved into the first field operational devices commercially available to government,2010

Zagirova FGUP “VNIIFTRI ” 141570 Mendeleevo Russia E-mail: nkoshelyaevsky@vniiftri.ru Abstract A campaign on the State Time and Frequency Standard modernization is continuing.,A second prototype of the primary Cs fountain standard with an uncertainty of 5  10 -16 is under assemblage and is scheduled to be ready by the end of 2011. Today we have two new ensembles each of four H-masers of type CH1-75A with individual cavity auto-tuning systems. The whole instrumentation set includes distribution amplifiers a frequency and time measuring system and a real-time scale generation and distribution system. All these instruments are installed in thermally and humidity controlled chambers. As a result the frequency stability of H-masers for a 1-day basis is about a few parts in 10 -16 . The new remote clock comparison system consists of several multichannel dual-frequenys GLONASS/GPS TTS-3 receivers. A new GLONASS/GPS/GALILEO TTS-4 receiver is expected by the end of November. All TTS-3 receivers were differentially calibrated relative to BIPM’s portable receiver last year. Just now we have completed new measurements within a new calibration campaign arranged by the BIPM. Two TWSTFT stationary stations and a transportable one were tested in VNIIFTRI last summer. VNIIFTRI is ready to join the Europe-Asia link via the AM-2 satellite when it,2010

2010papers/paper1.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy since 1830,and via DoD Directive 4650.05 is the sole source of timing for the Department of Defense. In cooperation with other institutions the USNO also provides timing for the United States and the international community. Its Master Clock (MC) is the source of UTC (USNO) USNO’s realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which has stayed within 5 ns rms of UTC since 1999 and within 4 ns rms in 2010. The data used to generate UTC (USNO) are based upon 69 cesium and 26 hydrogen maser frequency standards in four buildings at two sites. USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem Network Time Protocol (NTP) GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). This paper describes some of the changes being made to meet the future needs for precision accuracy and robustness. Further details and explanations of our services can be found online at http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO. I. TIME GENERATION The most important part of USNO’s Time Service Department is its staff which currently consists of 32 positions. Of these the largest group about 40% of the staff is directly involved in time transfer. The rest are fairly evenly divided between those who service the clocks those who monitor them and those who are working to develop new ones. The core stability of USNO time is based upon the clock ensemble. We currently have 69 HP5071 cesium clocks made by Hewlett-Packard/Agilent/Symmetricom and 26 cavity-tuned “Sigma-Tau/Datum/Symmetricom” hydrogen maser clocks which are located in three Washington D.C. buildings and at the USNO Alternate Master Clock (AMC) located at,2010
2010papers/paper16.pdf,SIMPLE METHODS FOR THE ESTIMATION OF THE SHORT-TERM STABILITY OF GNSS ON-BOARD CLOCKS Jérôme Delporte Cyrille Boulanger and Flavien Mercier CNES French Space Agency 18 avenue Edouard Belin 31401 Toulouse cedex 9 France jerome.delporte@cnes.fr Abstract,The estimation of GNSS on-board clocks behavior is generally a complex task requiring a large ground infrastructure (a global network of ground stations) and an intense computation (the so-called ODTS Orbit Determination and Time Synchronization). Here we propose two alternative methods that allow one to easily estimate the short-term stability of GNSS on-board clocks with respect to a given ground station on a pass. In the first method we simply consider the phase measurements of the RINEX observation files provided by the ground station on which we apply a high-order polynomial fitting. Thus we keep the high-frequency part of the measurement which is expected to be representative of the clock difference. In the second method we carry out a residuals computation on a given pass using precise ephemerides. The ground station phase measurements are considered. We compute the transmission dates and the satellites’ position by interpolation of these dates. Then we compute the theoretical pseudo- distance using the satellites’ position and the measurements; the vertical troposphere delay is adjusted. The difference between the measurements and the theoretical pseudo-distance provides an estimation of the clock difference. With these two methods we can compute the stability of a GNSS on-board clock for each phase observable and for the iono-free phase combination. Obviously this requires that the stability of the ground station clock is better than the stability of the GNSS on-board clock that we want to estimate. The estimation obtained of the on-board clock has the same sampling rate as the input RINEX phase measurements. For GPS on-board clocks the results of these two methods using 1 Hz ground stations measurements have been compared to the IGS COD clock products that have a sampling rate of,2010

2010papers/paper2.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE JHU APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY Mihran Miranian Gregory L. Weaver Matthew J. Reinhart and Richard A. Dragonette JHU/Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD USA Abstract The Time and Frequency Laboratory (TFL) at the Johns Hopkins University Applied,Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) provides support to multiple NASA/JPL missions that span our solar system from the study of the Sun’s coronal mass ejections (STEREO) to the examination of the outer planets and the Kuiper Belt objects (New Horizons). This support includes providing precise time and frequency to the integration and testing of flight hardware frequency reference for spacecraft ranging and communications via the APL communications facility and the time-stamping of ground receipt telemetry packets from various spacecraft. The TFL’s ensemble of three high-performance cesium standards and three hydrogen masers are integrated to form the APL timescale that is the basis for estimating UTC – UTC (APL) and for evaluating the performance of the individual clocks. Traceability to the USNO NIST and UTC is maintained via GPS common-view and all-in-view time transfer. The TFL’s clocks are also incorporated into the formulation of International Atomic Time (TAI). Recently the TFL Master Clock was transitioned from a cesium-beam frequency standard to a hydrogen maser and the frequency adjustments of UTC (APL) are now performed with a high-resolution offset generator. These changes have greatly improved the stability of UTC (APL) and have also improved our ability to steer to UTC.,2010
2010papers/paper29.pdf,VERY PRECISE SYNCHRONIZATION OF A GROUP OF PSEUDOLITES Werner R. Lange Lange-Electronic GmbH Gernlinden Germany T.: +49-8142-2845820 WLange@lange-electronic.de Abstract,Pseudolites are GNSS transmitters that have a fixed position on the ground and transmit original satellite signals. Very often pseudolites are used around airports and harbors to ease the navigation and increase integrity and availability of satellite navigation systems. Pseudolites are also used in the European “Gate”-Projects. “GATE” is the name of a Galileo test bed where several pseudolites are located around a valley in southeast Bavaria transmitting Galileo signals so that receivers are able to use Galileo signals for testing purpose in “real life” before the satellites are in the sky. Besides this first Gate project a number of similar pseudolite projects have been established. One of these projects is named “aviation gate” and is located at the research airport of Braunschweig. This project shall show the use of Galileo signals in aviation – from approach to landing to taxiing. It is extremely important to synchronize the pseudolites as well as possible to minimize the navigation errors. The system in Braunschweig consists of nine pseudolites and a reference station. The pseudolites are mounted in an inner circle of five systems around the airport and four systems in distances between 30 and 60 km. In the present stage of the project the inner circle is working and the outer circle is under construction. The paper describes the basics and goals of the project and includes the results of the first phase of the project – five free-running GPS receivers are synchronizing five pseudolites. The results look very promising – the five receivers are far better synchronized than anticipated; they are working in a range of about ±2ns.,2010

2010papers/paper9.pdf,AN NTP STRATUM-ONE SERVER FARM FED BY IEEE-1588 Richard E. Schmidt and Blair Fonville Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory 3450 Massachusetts Ave. NW Washington D.C. 20392 USA rich.schmidt@usno.navy.mil blair.fonville@usno.navy.mil Abstract For the past 16 years USNO’s Network Time Protocol (NTP) stratum-1 servers,have been synchronized to its Master Clocks via IRIG-B time code on a low- frequency RF distribution system. The availability of Precise Time Protocol (PTP IEEE-1588) host-based interfaces will enable the deployment of NTP servers fed by IEEE-1588 over conventional Ethernet networks. This paper describes a PTP GrandMaster/Slave network which maintains synchronization of internal (stratum- 0) NTP reference clocks to within tens of nanoseconds. The configuration of a PTP network and the effects of various PTP configuration options are demonstrated. USNO NETWORK TIME SERVICE The U.S. Naval Observatory has provided public stratum-1 NTP network time service continuously since 1994 [1] . At present the Washington D.C. NTP servers receive more than one-half billion hits per day (with on-the-hour peaks in excess of 20 000 packets per second) from millions of unique IP addresses. In order to handle this load and to provide redundancy USNO operates an NTP “server farm” with Ethernet traffic controlled by a pair of CAI Networks 590SG load balancers (Figure 1). All traffic to these NTP servers passes first through the one active member of the pair of load balancers (the inactive being a hot stand-by). It is the load balancer’s duty to assign each incoming NTP request to one of the available servers balancing the load by round-robin weighted round-robin least active connections or other algorithm. Each NTP server returns packets to the load balancer for forwarding back to the requestor.,2010

In order to circumvent the uncertainty associated with the blackbody shift we have built a new fountain NIST-F2 in which the microwave interrogation region is cryogenic (80 K) reducing the blackbody shift to negligible levels. We briefly describe here the series of improvements to NIST-F1 that have allowed its uncertainty to reach the low 10 -16 level and present early results from NIST-F2. 1.

2010papers/paper34.pdf,COMPENSATED FIBER-OPTIC FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT John MacDonald and George Conway Linear Photonics L.L.C. Abstract One-way frequency distribution of atomic clock standards has been widely studied and several architectures have emerged that employ the use of a return path signal to compensate for the effects of temperature and phase noise. These architectures have generally relied upon,temperature-controlled delay lines to compensate for fiber thermal effects and polarization scrambling techniques to minimize the impact of polarization mode dispersion (PMD). These compensation techniques can limit the performance of the system by introducing spurious noise products onto the optical carrier. Uncompensated one-way fiber optic distribution systems are currently deployed with a demonstrated stability of 2·10 –13 (1 sec). Without temperature compensation this equipment is suitable for intra-facility distribution of hydrogen maser references. However operation over moderate length inter-facility links (IFL) will degrade the stability significantly due in large part to the temperature effects of the outdoor or underground fiber cable. The stability can be improved through the use of temperature-compensated fiber cable but this type of cable is typically an order of magnitude more costly than standard fiber. Furthermore many locations already have installed dark fiber whose use would be more cost effective. We are developing a compensated one-way frequency distribution system that is compact easy to install and requires neither polarization scramblers nor large thermally controlled delay lines. The system employs forward and reverse path microwave modulated optical carriers on a single fiber.

2010papers/poster7.pdf,THE STABILITY OF GPS CARRIER-PHASE RECEIVERS Lee A. Breakiron U.S. Naval Observatory 3450 Massachusetts Ave. NW Washington DC USA 20392 USA lee.breakiron@usno.navy.mil Abstract GPS carrier-phase (CP) time and frequency transfer is a convenient and reliable method to,compare distant ground clocks. Short- and long-baseline experiments were performed to ascertain whether CP receivers are sufficiently stable for use in the calibration of Two-Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer equipment and the comparison of primary frequency standards. The results were affirmative demonstrating a time transfer precision of about 100 ps or better in a few days over short baselines and about 100 ps at 1 day and about 300 ps at 5 days over long baselines provided the receivers hold their calibration are operated under environmentally controlled conditions and are connected to phase-stable antenna cable.,2010

Qubits are represented as harmonic functions in a two-dimensional vector space. Multiplication of qubit representations of different frequencies results in exponential growth of the state space similar to the tensor-product composition of qubit spaces in quantum mechanics. Individual qubits remain accessible in a composite system which is represented as a complex function of a single variable though entanglement imposes a demand on resources that scales exponentially with the number of entangled qubits. We carry out a simulation of Shor’s algorithm and discuss a simpler implementation in this classical model. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.79.042320 PACS number  s  : 03.67.Lx 03.65.Sq 03.65.Ta,2009
2009papers/paper49.pdf,TRACKING BIASES CAUSED BY IMPERFECTIONS IN DLL RECEIVERS Gerhard Hejc and Wolfgang Schaefer TimeTech GmbH D-70569 Stuttgart Germany Abstract Delay Lock Loop (DLL) is a feedback system that is able to track the code phase of a pseudo-noise (PN) signal. Imperfections in the DLL or the RF front end may or may not lead,to tracking biases which have to be removed by a receiver-specific calibration factor. The goal of this work is to show that also imperfections (spectral asymmetry of the signal carrier-phase imbalance of the DLL) which do not change the code phase can result in significant biases when both effects are combined.,2009

2009papers/poster9.pdf,PROTOTYPE OF THE DLR OPERATIONAL COMPOSITE CLOCK: METHODS AND TEST CASES Matthias Suess and Jens Hammesfahr E-mail: Matthias.suess@dlr.de German Aerospace Centre (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen Germany Abstract The operational implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter Composite Clock (CC,developed by K. R. Brown) is the subject of this paper. Although the mathematical background of the CC is well-known its autonomous and robust operation in a clock laboratory requires further modifications of the CC. The suitable initialization of the first ensemble estimate is discussed. Due to the fact that only difference measurements are available there is a dimensional degree of freedom in the first as in the following ensemble estimates. Furthermore to guarantee a robust consistent and autonomous estimation of the ensemble clocks a consistency check is described. It outputs a so-called consistency matrix which describes the active and non-active clocks. Since the identified active clocks can change from measurement to measurement the corresponding Kalman filter (KF) parameters are adapted in a consistent way. Finally the non-active clocks are estimated based on the KF output. The performance of the OCC using an ensemble of five DLR laboratory clocks measured over a period of 1 year is outlined. The clock ensemble consists of three high-performance cesium- clocks (HP5071A) an active H-maser (CH1-75) and a GPS-disciplined Rb clock. Although miscellaneous anomalies like phase steps outliers and clock exclusions arise the OCC autonomously processes the five ensemble clocks and establishes a robust system time. Analysis results of this ensemble with different types of clocks when applying the OCC are presented. SYSTEM TIME CONCEPTS FOR GNSS Besides orbits and other system parameters a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) generates and provides satellite clock offsets to the users. The clock or time offsets are with respect to (w.r.t.) the GNSS system time (ST). It is an integral part of the GNSS and is a key element of the GNSS,2009

2009papers/paper11.pdf,NEGATIVE POWER LAW NOISE REALITY VS. MYTH Victor S. Reinhardt Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems El Segundo CA USA Abstract In this paper it is shown that two popular conceptions about the behavior of negative power law (neg-p) noise—that is noise with a PSD L,p (f)  |f| p for p<0—are based on myth and that the reality is quite different. The first myth is that one can “fix” a neg-p divergence problem in a variance like a standard or N-sample variance simply by replacing it with an Allan or Hadamard variance without further action. The paper will show that each type of variance has a different interpretation as an error measure and that such arbitrary swapping merely masks the true problem. In the process we will show that such variance divergences are true indicators of severe system or modeling problems that must be physically addressed not ignored. The second myth is that one can use ensemble-based statistical estimation techniques like least squares and Kalman filters to properly estimate polynomial deterministic behavior in data containing non-highpass filtered neg-p noise. It is demonstrated that such noise can generate highly anomalous fitting results because non-highpass-filtered neg-p noise is both infinitely correlated and non-ergodic. Thus non-p noise is shown to act more like systematic error than conventional noise in such cases. I.,2009

2009papers/paper38.pdf,TWSTFT DATA TREATMENT FOR UTC TIME TRANSFER Z. Jiang W. Lewandowski and H. Konaté Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) Pavillon de Breteuil F-92312 Sèvres Cedex France E-mail: zjiang@bipm.org Abstract TWSTFT (TW) is the primary technique of time and frequency transfers used at BIPM,for the UTC/TAI generations. At present some 19 laboratories operate a TW facility and 12 of them are officially used in practice. The latter contribute more than two-thirds of the atomic clocks and almost all the primary frequency standards to UTC and TAI. In addition to its major role as a precise and an independent technique to GNSS TW is used to evaluate the new GNSS techniques. In fact all the recent GNSS techniques finally used in UTC/TAI transfers have been approved by the comparisons with TW such as GPS P3 GPS All in View GPS PPP etc. A pilot study on the GLONASS time transfer is undertaking at BIPM and again TW is an indispensable tool. Unlike the earlier publications discussing the technical details in TW this paper focuses rather on the data treatment performed at BIPM: raw data collection detection of outliers in the raw data the calibration the interpolation methods and the link comparison with other techniques as well as the availability of the raw and treated data sets on the Web. The authors would like the transparency of BIPM work to be helpful to the whole timing communication. It is pointed in the end that TW and GPS PPP are each complementary and the combination of the two techniques will further improve the quality of the UTC time transfer.,2009
2009papers/paper4.pdf,THE COMMON TIME MODULE A ROBUST TIME MAINTENANCE SYSTEM Andrew Dowd and Dr. R. Michael Garvey Symmetricom Inc. Abstract The Common Time Module (CTM) is being developed by Symmetricom with support from the US Army/CERDEC. The goal is to implement timing services for mobile systems that demand a high degree of reliability and precision. The system is based around a core module,that implements a time and frequency server with provisions for legacy time protocols. To address the rigors of a mobile and dynamic environment the CTM manages multiple connections to the common time reference (UTC-USNO). Either GNSS signals (GPS) or a network connection (IEEE-1588) can synchronize local time services. In addition the CTM integrates a low-power atomic resonator for extended holdover capabilities. By dynamically managing these technologies the CTM can supply accurate time and frequency in a wide range of deployment scenarios. Furthermore improvements in low-power technology such as Chip- Scale-Atomic-Clock (CSAC) will dramatically reduce power requirement which is a significant advantage to mobile systems. Finally this paper will examine how standardized IEEE-1588 network techniques will be applied to support redundancy with the CTM.,2009

2009papers/paper1.pdf,USE OF GLONASS AT THE BIPM W. Lewandowski and Z. Jiang Bureau International des Poids et Mesures Sèvres France Abstract The Russian Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS) provides interesting opportunities for international time metrology. The GLONASS constellation is now in the final stages of construction and can already be used for international time transfer. At least 19 national time,laboratories are now equipped with the most recent GPS/GLONASS time receivers. The BIPM collects data from these receivers and is now publishing related time links. GLONASS links are now compared on a regular basis to GPS links and will also soon be compared to TWSTFT links. This paper reports the latest results from the BIPM.,2009

2009papers/opening.pdf,OPENING REMARKS Capt. R. Scott Steadley U.S. Naval Observatory,Ladies and Gentlemen: Interval Meeting. This series of PTTI Meetings has provided a valuable forum for participants to share their ideas and demonstrate applications that challenge current capabilities while stimulating innovative improvements in the contribution of PTTI to the global infrastructure. These meetings have also allowed providers of time and time interval to make system developers aware of the latest improvements and those that are likely to be available in the future. The PTTI Systems and Applications Meeting is sponsored by the U.S. Naval Observatory the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Defense Information Systems Agency and the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Center to pursue four stated objectives. These are: 1) to disseminate and coordinate PTTI information at the user level 2) to review present and future PTTI requirements 3) to inform Government engineers technicians and managers of precise time and frequency technology and 4) to provide an opportunity for an active exchange of new technology. The sessions outlined in the program of this meeting are well suited to address these objectives ranging from reports on the latest activities at laboratories from around the world to a preview of the program for the 2030 Meeting. A quick glance at that program clearly demonstrates that PTTI is an active area of development. The lab reports from approximately a dozen countries show that this development is worldwide and that the requirements for PTTI continue to expand on an international scale.

2009papers/paper26.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy since 1830,and via DoD Directive 4650.05 is the sole source of timing for the Department of Defense. In cooperation with other institutions the USNO also provides timing for the United States and the international community. Its Master Clock (MC) is the source of UTC (USNO) USNO’s realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which has stayed within 5 ns rms of UTC since 1999 and within 3.9 ns rms in 2009. The data used to generate UTC (USNO) are based upon 60 cesium and 24 hydrogen maser frequency standards in four buildings at two sites. USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem LORAN Network Time Protocol (NTP) GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). This paper describes some of the changes being made to meet the future needs for precision accuracy and robustness. Further details and explanations of our services can be found online at,2009

In the past the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has used techniques ranging from coaxial cables to basic fiber links to transfer 5 MHz Master Clock signals. Recently USNO installed new fiber runs on its campus along with newly designed laser modules. Several months of data have now been collected with the new transceivers driving these inter-building fiber links. The modules were also tested in an environmental chamber to evaluate their temperature sensitivities. The laser modules alone show more than a factor of 10 improvement over previous transceivers used at USNO. We are also investigating actively stabilized laser links to further improve our ability to transfer Master Clock signals.,2009

2009papers/paper34.pdf,OPTIMAL TIME TRANSFER James R. Wright and James Woodburn Analytical Graphics Inc. 220 Valley Creek Blvd Exton PA 19341 USA Abstract We have designed an optimal time transfer algorithm using GPS carrier-phase and pseudo- range measurements. This will enable the near-real-time estimation of the difference between,the phase of a stable real-time UTC ground clock attached to a GPS ground receiver and the phase of each NAVSTAR spacecraft clock in the ensemble of GPS spacecraft. We propose a master filter (MF) to drive multiple instances of spawned filters (SF) and fixed-epoch smoothers (FES). The MF is designed to map all GPS carrier-phase measurement information of each GPS ground-station/NAVSTAR pass into the complete MF state estimate of all NAVSTAR parameters and all station parameters with all serial correlations and all cross-correlations accounted for. Each SF runs forward with time while the FES linearly maps measurement information backwards to fixed epochs for individual NAVSTAR spacecraft. FES estimates are then folded into the MF as pseudo-measurements. The resulting time-transfer algorithm is an autonomous forward-running sequential estimator with no state-sized matrix inverse calculations required 1 .,2009

2009papers/paper47.pdf,LOCAL OSCILLATOR CONTRIBUTION TO CARRIER-PHASE MEASUREMENTS IN A GNSS RECEIVER E. Detoma L. Bonafede and P. Capetti SEPA S.p.A. Via Andrea Pozzo 8 10141 Torino Italy Abstract When performing carrier-phase measurements the measurement noise affecting the,observations reflects two contributions originating from the thermal noise of the RF signal received at the antenna and from the stability of the local oscillator over the integration time since normally some form of phase-locked loop (PLL) is used for carrier recovery. The order of the PLL (and the bandwidth) determines the amount of the oscillator contribution to the measurement noise for a given oscillator frequency stability (or since the integration time is generally less or equal to 1 s to its phase noise). Therefore it is important to understand the mechanism by which the local oscillator instability is transferred to the carrier-phase measurement noise and select a proper oscillator to minimize such a contribution. In the paper we will address these issues providing examples that guide the selection of the local oscillator. A practical example of implementation will be discussed where a low-cost high-stability OCXO has been disciplined to a Rb frequency standard to provide improved stability over the integration times of interest in order to minimize the noise for carrier-phase recovery. CARRIER-PHASE TRACKING AND LOCAL OSCILLATOR CONTRIBUTION In the following our aim is to define a model and determine the contributions for the stochastic errors affecting the performance of the typical GPS (GNSS) receiver. We will consider errors on pseudorange and carrier-phase measurements. Under our assumptions we will consider the receiver as a measurement instrument with the target of providing the required measurement (carrier phase or pseudorange) with the best precision.,2009
2009papers/poster5.pdf,FREQUENCY AND PHASE BREAK DETECTION Scott Czopek E-mail: scott.czopek@colorado.edu Abstract A phase break detection method is proposed and successfully tested for the CANVAS analysis software for frequency standards. Phase breaks are detected above the noise floor by classifying a very large phase step as a phase break. This detection method succeeds in,numerically quantifying a large visual jump in the phase plot without using input parameters other than the phase data. These phase breaks are automatically identified by the software and then are removed from the data. To implement this solution it is assumed that the frequency standard is well behaved. The most extreme phase steps (1% of the total data) are assumed to contain all phase breaks and other misbehaving data points and this small subset of 1% is neglected during the detection method’s preliminary analysis. If these assumptions are violated then this phase-break detection method does not apply to the set. The phase-break detection algorithm still needs to be interfaced with the CANVAS user interface. Also this method and the frequency-break detection method are intended for post-process use. A frequency-break detection method is also proposed and the assumptions that invalidate the method are explained. BACKGROUND This work is the author’s first paper. It was done under the supervision of Dr. Ken Senior at the Naval Research Laboratory during the summer of 2009 and continued during the fall semester at the University of Colorado at Boulder. The author was an undergraduate when this paper was prepared but graduated December 2009 with a Bachelor’s degree in physics and a minor in mathematics. Clock data for this paper came from the GPS Block IIF Rubidium atomic clock #25 under life test at the Naval Research Lab and a hydrogen maser. The GPS Rubidium Clock has been in operation since 22 August 2008 [1] .,2009

Manginell Sandia National Laboratories P.O. Box 5800 Albuquerque NM 87185 USA Abstract We are developing a highly miniaturized trapped ion clock to probe the 12.6 GHz hyperfine transition in the,171 Yb + ion. The clock development is being funded by the Integrated Micro Primary Atomic Clock Technology (IMPACT) program from DARPA where the stated goals are to develop a clock that consumes 50 mW of power has a size of 5 cm 3 and has a long-term frequency stability of 10 -14 at 1 month. Trapped ion systems are an excellent candidate for such extreme miniaturization because ions are well isolated from the environment independently of the size of the trap. Trapped ion clocks are characterized by quality factors Q in excess of 10 12 and excellent long-term stability and the Q will be minimally degraded upon miniaturization. To realize the clock in a small package will require the miniaturization of several technologies. One of the primary technologies will be the miniaturized ion trap and vacuum package. Linear RF Paul traps routinely have dimensions of a couple millimeters but miniaturizing the vacuum package with an integral trap Yb source and pump will require a novel design. Integrating the miniature low-power light sources for state detection at 369 nm,2009

2009papers/poster2.pdf,DETECTION OF OUTLIERS IN TWSTFT DATA USED IN TAI A. Harmegnies G. Panfilo and E. F. Arias International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) Pavillon de Breteuil F-92312 Sèvres Cedex France E-mail: aharmeg@bipm.org gpanfilo@bipm.org farias@bipm.org Abstract,This paper describes a new filtering technique used to detect and eliminate outlying data in two-way satellite time and frequency transfer (TWSTFT) time links. In the case of TWSTFT data used to calculate International Atomic Time (TAI) three main problems have to be considered: the difficulty of recognizing outliers from useful data; the need to avoid deleting useful data; that TWSTFT links can show an underlying slope which renders the standard treatment more difficult. Using phase and frequency filtering techniques a new way of detecting outliers while avoiding detection of useful data has been developed and implemented at the BIPM to clean TWSTFT data.,2009

Generated by means of an active hydrogen maser (AHM) and supported by an ensemble of cesium beam frequency standards hydrogen masers and cesium atomic fountains it is synchronized via satellite (GPS and TWSTFT Two Way Satellite Time and Frequency Transfer) with those generated by other international NMIs (National Metrological Institutes) and it is kept in agreement with the international time scale UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) computed by BIPM. Also TFL regularly contributes to the realization of the TAI time scale sending to BIPM the measurement results carried out following protocols defined at the international level. In this paper the status of the TFL is presented highlighting the wide range of ongoing activities that are carried out in order to enhance its robustness and performances with the aim to better solve the task of national NMI as well as preparing for providing accurate and reliable services to the European navigation system Galileo. In particular the automatic measuring and controlling system functions basically to collect essential timing measurements and synchronization data together with information about the status of all the equipment involved in the measurement processes. In order to improve the current system and to cope with ISO/IEC 17025 standard requirements a new system called DMS (Data Management System) has been designed allowing for an efficient integration of data coming from different sources. This system will work associated with a informatics system called FMS (File Management System) that will allow for flexible and robust management of the measurement files to be exchanged within the TFL and with external,2011

2011papers/Paper07.pdf,CHALLENGES USING IEEE 1588-2008 PRECISION TIME PROTOCOL (PTP) FOR HIGH ACCURACY TIME TRANSFER David Wilson Naval Research Laboratory Washington D.C. Abstract The NRL Space Applications Branch evaluated PTP devices from several vendors to,determine their suitability for high accuracy time transfer (< 1 ns) applications. The IEEE Std 1588-2008 Clause 1.1 states “the standard permits synchronization accuracies better than 1 ns.” A time transfer accuracy of 1 ns has proven difficult if not impossible to achieve especially when using PTP devices from different vendors. This paper discusses the challenges of achieving 1 ns time transfer using PTP and possible solutions to these challenges.,2011
2011papers/Paper13.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy since 1830 and via,DoD Directives 4650.05 and 4650.07 is the sole source of timing for the Department of Defense. In cooperation with other institutions the USNO also provides timing for the United States and the international community. Its Master Clock (MC) is the source of UTC(USNO) USNO’s realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which has stayed within 5 ns rms of UTC since 1999 and within 4 ns rms in 2011. The data used to generate UTC(USNO) are based upon 87 cesium 38 hydrogen maser and now also 4 rubidium fountain frequency standards in four buildings at two sites. USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem Network Time Protocol (NTP) GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). This paper describes some of the changes being made to meet the future needs for precision accuracy and robustness. Further details and explanations of our services can be found online at http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time. I. TIME GENERATION The most important part of USNO’s Time Service Department is its staff which currently consists of 33 positions. Of these the largest group about 40% of the staff is directly involved in time transfer. The rest are fairly evenly divided between those who service the clocks those who monitor them and those who are working to develop new ones. The core stability of USNO time is based upon the clock ensemble. The clocks used for the USNO timescale are kept in environments whose temperatures are kept constant to within 0.1 deg C and whose relative humidities (for all fountains and masers and most cesiums) are kept constant to within 1%. This year a large number of our Washington clocks were moved into our new clock building and several of,2011

Petit Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) Pavillon de Breteuil F-92312 SEVRES CEDEX France zjiang@bipm.org Abstract The uncertainty u A,of clock comparisons as reported in the BIPM Circular T is defined as the statistical uncertainty evaluated by taking into account the level of phase noise in the raw data the interpolation interval and effects with typical duration between 5 days and 30 days. The first global evaluation of u A was performed in 2002. Since then time-transfer techniques have improved significantly. New techniques have been introduced at different periods and the methods used to estimate their uncertainty u A were not necessarily consistent. In this paper we propose a revised definition of u A and recalculate its value for all 67 links used in UTC. NOTATION AND ABBREVIATIONS d Link Link difference:,2011

We have produced laser-cooled Wigner crystals of 229 Th 3+ in a linear Paul trap providing a convenient system to search for this nuclear transition and to utilize its potential with high precision spectroscopy. Furthermore we have measured isotope shifts magnetic dipole (A) and electric quadrupole (B) hyperfine constants for four low-lying electronic levels deducing a new value of the spectroscopic nuclear electric quadrupole moment Q = 3.11(16) eb. These measurements provide a reference for evaluation of the sensitivity of the nuclear transition to the variation of the fundamental constants including the fine structure constant.,2011

Whibberley National Physical Laboratory Hampton Road Teddington Middlesex TW11 0LW UK Email: setnam.shemar@npl.co.uk Abstract In the last few years the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has been investigating a Kal-,man-filter based atomic clock ensemble algorithm as part of its long-term strategy for improv- ing the stability of the UK’s national time scale UTC(NPL). To achieve this Flicker Frequency Modulation (FFM) clock noise has been modeled within the algorithm using integrated Mar- kov noise processes. Recent results have indicated the performance of the composite time scale generated for a 150-day data-set using an ensemble of two 5071A cesium clocks together with three active hydrogen masers. Here we firstly investigate the performance of the algorithm us- ing a longer data-set of 846 days. We then investigate its performance by comparison against UTC and NPL’s cesium fountain NPL-CsF2. We also consider how data from NPL-CsF2 can be exploited within the algorithm to improve the stability of the generated composite. Finally we briefly discuss the potential application of such an algorithm for improving the stability of the UK’s national time scale UTC(NPL).,2011
2011papers/Paper24.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY BROADCAST WITH DCF77 D. Piester A. Bauch J. Becker and A. Hoppmann Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) Bundesallee 100 38116 Braunschweig Germany dirk.piester@ptb.de Abstract For over fifty years the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) has disseminated,time signals and standard frequency by means of the low-frequency transmitter DCF77. In addition since the 1970s legal time for Germany has been broadcast using coded time information by way of amplitude modulated second markers. This service especially has become very popular and DCF77 has developed to an important part of Germany’s state funded infrastructure. In the 1980s binary phase shift keying using a pseudo random noise code sequence was added to enable a high precision and reliable time reception. In 2003 the feasibility of using vacant coding capacity of the DCF77 scheme for public warning messages was tested and since 2006 the same capacity has been used for the transmission of encrypted weather forecast information under responsibility of Meteo Time GmbH. The advantages of DCF77 in particular its wide range of reception with low cost receivers have led through the years to the use of millions DCF77 radio-controlled clocks which provide exact time throughout central Europe. We briefly report on the current broadcast program including the features listed above and the current characteristics of the transmitted signals and we give an overview of the technical equipment used for signal generation and monitoring.,2011

2011papers/Poster07.pdf,DEVELOPMENT OF AN EXTREMELY LOW POWER RADIO STATION FOR GENERATING STANDARD TIME SIGNAL USING NTP H. Maeno F. Nakagawa H. Toriyama A. Machizawa T. Iwama and K. Imamura National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) maeno@nict.go.jp Abstract,Radio controlled watches and clocks and automatically adjust the time by receiving the LF time and frequency standards. These watches are in wide use mainly in U.S.A. Germany and Japan. In Japan it is said that more than fifty or sixty million watches have been sold so far. There is however a big problem that it is rather difficult to receive radio waves in inappropriate environments such as inside of buildings undergrounds and places where electromagnetic noise is predominant and consequently it is unsuitable to use them in the above places. NICT has developed an extremely low power radio station for radio controlled watches and clocks which disseminates the LF time standard acquired by the NTP server. Radio watches would be available even in unsuitable places such as airports subway stations sports stadiums and so forth. In addition it makes it possible to use Japanese-made radio watches not only in Japan but in other countries by setting the local time zone.,2011

The Sun Moon and Earth hurl through space and their gravitational fields cause the tides which is a slight redistribution of ocean mass. This redistributed mass perturbs the Earth’s gravitational potential affecting atomic clocks. The magnitude of this perturbation will be quantified correcting for this effect. The predicted fractional frequency offset (10 −19 ) is too small to be detected but this effect may become visible in the future.,2011

2011papers/Paper26.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY TRANSFER USING EGNOS SATELLITE SYSTEM Petr Pánek and Alexander Kuna Institute of Photonics and Electronics AS CR Chaberská 57 182 51 Prague Czech Republic E-mail: panek@ufe.cz kuna@ufe.cz Abstract EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) is the European satellite navigation system which augments GPS and makes it suitable for safety critical applications. It,is one of the Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). It uses three geostationary satellites transmitting signals in the GPS L1 frequency channel. These signals are almost identical to the GPS signal and thus can be used for time transfer in the same way. Since the geostationary satellites move slightly and very slowly towards the user one can assume that some of the measurement errors (e.g. multipath atmospheric delay) will also show small and slow variation compared to GPS measurements and better performance of the time and frequency transfer can be expected. We therefore performed an experimental measurement in order to verify that the fluctuations in measured delay of the received signal caused by multipath are really much slower compared with using GPS and the time transfer can be improved by using EGNOS. We applied the same time reference to a pair of GTR50 receivers and performed the time comparison against one of the EGNOS satellites. Antennas with hemispheric directional characteristics were used. The distance between the antennas was 5.5 m. From the continuous several-day measurement we observed that the code measurement has markedly lower accuracy compared to the signal from GPS (10 ns standard deviation). This is caused by the narrow bandwidth of the transmitted signal which is only 2.2 MHz in the case of EGNOS. We confirmed that the fluctuations caused by multipath are very slow but with relatively higher amplitude. On the other hand the results obtained from the carrier phase measurements are promising. The standard deviation from the whole measurement was 12 ps. Together with the white phase noise we observed small diurnal fluctuations in the measured,2011

2011papers/Paper09.pdf,INVESTIGATING THE BIASES IN ALLAN AND HADAMARD VARIANCES AS MEASURES OF M TH ORDER RANDOM STABILITY Victor R. Reinhardt Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems El Segundo CA USA Abstract Allan and Hadamard variances (AHVs) generated from data consisting of purely random,noise are well-known as mean square measures of M th order random stability (MORS) over the difference interval  . When data contain deterministic drift (intrinsic aging plus environmentally induced temporal changes) as well as noise however it is also well known that AHVs can be biased measures of MORS. In such cases one generally minimizes this bias by “removing” the drift from the data in question using auxiliary data fitting methods and then generating the AHV using the drift-removed residuals. This paper investigates the nature of one aspect of the residual AHV bias that remains after such drift-removal: kernel or K stat (f)-bias. This bias exhibits itself in the spectral integral representation of a drift-removed AHV as an alteration of the spectral kernel K stat (f) that relates the AHV to S(f) the power spectral density of the random data component from the non-drift removed AHV. This K stat (f)-bias occurs because a fitting,2011

2011papers/Paper42.pdf,CHARACTERIZING DYNAMIC EFFECTS OF OSCILLATOR POWER CYCLING D. A. Howe D. Lirette N. Ashby A. Hati and C. Nelson Time and Frequency Division NIST Boulder CO USA Email: dhowe@nist.gov Abstract We create a measurement technique and easy to interpret metrics to be used in development,of new oscillators specifically for applications in which the oscillator’s power is turned on and off. This is useful in predicting the performance in for example the frequency-difference-of- arrival (FDOA) geolocation technique which is used to monitor and track an emitter’s location by observing its Doppler frequency shifts at a set of receivers. To conserve energy FDOA applications compute Doppler tracks from an emitter that is powered “on” or measured for short periods (τ on ) after a long “off” period called the “stride” interval (τ s ). For lowest size weight and power (SWaP) and lowest phase noise and best frequency stability evaluations are focused on Oven-Controlled Crystal Oscillators (OCXO’s) and Temperature-Controlled Crystal Oscillators (TCXO’s). For illustration we use τ on = 3 s and τ s = 60 s. This shows the need to consider the dynamic behavior during the short 3 s average frequency measurements as well as the 60 s sampling interval between measurements. Dynamic Allan Deviation (ADEV) does not accurately capture different noise types for such a short 3 s sample so we propose using,2011

Tavella Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) Torino Italy p.tavella@inrim.it Abstract Since 1999 different timing activities at the INRiM (formerly IEN G. Ferraris) are devoted to the development of the European Satellite Navigation System Galileo in collaboration with European space industries and the European Space Agency (ESA). Currently four main,projects are in progress. In early 2006 an experimental phase called “Galileo System Test Bed V2 (GSTB V2)” or “GIOVE Mission” has been launched supported by ESA and INRiM takes part in it hosting a Galileo prototype receiver connected to the time reference signals and analyzing the data coming from the first experimental Galileo satellites in order to characterize the onboard clocks. In addition INRiM is also involved in the Galileo development (phase CDE1) supported by ESA by designing the time scale algorithm of one of the Galileo ground time laboratories named the Precise Time Facility. A consortium of different industries and UTC (k) laboratories are developing the prototype of the Galileo Time Service Provider supported by the European Union with the aim to provide to the Galileo system the necessary corrections to maintain the Galileo system time in agreement with UTC. INRiM contributes as one of the UTC (k) laboratories supporting also the algorithm standardization and BIPM interface activities. Recently INRiM began to develop an integrity algorithm for monitoring the clock and identifying possible malfunctioning. INRIM THE ITALIAN NATIONAL,2008

Therefore advancing the JHU/APL USO capability by improving its frequency stability without diminishing reliability is uniquely valuable to the operations of space communication and navigation systems. Ultimately we expect that the call for expanded mission requirements involving the real-time coordination of mission assets will become commonplace in distributed space sensor systems and robotic planetary exploration. As these missions mature the requirements for high bandwidth communication and precise navigation will call for better time and frequency control infrastructure with exceptional reliability.,2008

The proper operation of the entire payload is dependent on the performance of the master oscillator or the onboard clock. Frequency Electronics Inc. (FEI) has been a key supplier of high- reliability oscillators for space applications since 1963 and in this paper we will present a short history of oscillators for space applications that include quartz-based oscillators rubidium- based oscillators and integrated timing/frequency generating systems. We will also present achieved performance of key parameters such as aging short-term stability and low power consumption. Design considerations to mitigate the effects of natural radiation in the space environment will be discussed as well as strategies to minimize frequency drift to assure mission lifetimes of 20 years or more. Furthermore to predict long-term frequency accuracy we will present data of unpowered oscillators that were manufactured between 1968 and 1985 for long- term space missions that have been recently powered-on and tested. The presented data will provide empirical evidence that may be used to estimate the performance of quartz-based and rubidium-based oscillators in space. I. BACKGROUND An essential component of any space vehicle is the onboard master oscillator and the proper operation of the entire payload is dependent on the performance of the oscillator. Furthermore space programs require precision timekeeping and stable frequency generation and this requirement has been achieved with super-stable quartz oscillators and/or atomic frequency standards.

2008papers/paper17.pdf,STUDYING NETWORK TIMING WITH PRECISION PACKET DELAY MEASUREMENTS Lee Cosart R&D Symmetricom Inc. 2300 Orchard Parkway San Jose CA 95131 USA lcosart@symmetricom.com Abstract,As the transmission of telecommunications data is increasingly reliant on new generation packet network transport new methods of time and frequency transfer are required. While some of these methods are at the physical layer many involve the network and data link layers and are affected by packet network behavior. Thus it has become important to develop instrumentation and analysis techniques applicable to the study of packet latency and packet delay variation. Several of the packet network protocols which have been proposed for precision time and frequency transfer are NTP (Network Time Protocol) and IEEE 1588v2 also known as PTP (Precision Time Protocol). Systems designed for high-performance NTP or PTP contain the necessary elements for precision packet timing measurements namely a common precision timing reference from a source such as GPS and hardware timestamping capability. Such equipment has been developed over the past several years and has been used to make packet delay measurements both in the laboratory and in live operating production networks. The interpretation and analysis of packet timing data benefit from a combination of traditional techniques and new techniques. Certain analysis techniques applicable to traditional time and frequency measurements carry over to packet timing data while others are of little utility or in some cases benefit from modification. In this latter category is a new metric minTDEV based on one of the Allan deviation calculations. This paper starts with a discussion of the measurement techniques and systems used in the,2008

Tjoelker Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology 1 4800 Oak Grove Drive MS 298 Pasadena CA 91109 USA Abstract JPL is nearing completion of a new frequency reference generation and distribution system,to replace the DSN FTS Coherent Reference Generator (CRG). The existing CRG selects the online frequency standard synthesizes standard reference frequencies and provides fan-out to distribute to users which may be up to 30 km away. Like the existing CRG that is critical to DSN operation the replacement system must be extremely reliable and preserve the high stability and low phase noise performance of the central frequency standard. In addition in the replacement system the process and effect of switching to other backup or specialized frequency standards should also be transparent to DSN Operations. Reliability shortcomings of the old system are addressed by upgrading to modern and modular system components reducing the number of distributed frequencies and adding redundancy or managing single points of failure.,2008

VanZyl Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology E-mail: shervin.taghavi@jpl.nasa.gov Abstract,We are presenting here the concept of using the quality factor of a resonator in order to monitor angle shift in an incident signal based on a transmission [1]. As an example we treat the case where the resonator is a Fabry-Pérot etalon as a tool to monitor the incident angle change of the input waves. We will derive a boundary condition determining when the transmission of an incident wave through the etalon is either more sensitive to the wavelength change of the incident wave or to its incident angle change. That allows us to conclude when the etalon can be used as a tool to monitor the wavelength change of the incident light and when it can monitor its angle change. This concept is not just restricted to the Fabry-Pérot but is extended to any resonator having both an incident and transmitted light.,2008

These platforms will support a wide range of new and expanding applications in a more flexible and dynamic manner than in previous designs. This new paradigm creates significant network time synchronization challenges. The Navy has been deploying the Network Time Protocol (NTP) in shipboard computing infrastructures to meet the current network time synchronization requirements. Additionally a new standard IEEE 1588 or the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) has emerged. It holds the promise of more precise synchronization through the use of hardware assists. New international standardization efforts intend to leverage NTP and PTP for a next generation of time synchronization protocols. This paper examines the emerging work in the International Standards communities in the area of precise network time synchronization. Additionally it looks at preliminary evaluations of NTP and PTP in the types of products commonly used in Navy shipboard applications. Finally this paper proposes potential focus areas for Navy standardization and experimentation efforts.,2008
2008papers/paper24.pdf,ESTIMATING UTC – UTC (APL) AT THE JHU APPLIED PHYSICS LABORATORY Mihran Miranian Gregory L. Weaver and Matthew J. Reinhart JHU/Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel MD 20723 USA E-mail: mihran.miranian@jhuapl.edu Abstract Our master clock accuracy goal at the Time and Frequency Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) is to maintain UTC (APL) within,±20 nanoseconds of UTC. This is a challenging goal because it requires the estimation of the future character of UTC – UTC (APL) up to 6 weeks beyond the latest issue of Circular T from the BIPM. Furthermore the accuracy of our timescale-based estimation is challenged by the environmental influence on our ensemble of six clocks and the statistical limits to the dynamic characterization of these sources. This paper will describe the estimation algorithm used to determine the steering of UTC (APL). We will describe how the residual drift within the JHU/APL timescale affects our ability to estimate UTC – UTC (APL) and how we have modified the algorithm to remove this drift from the timescale prior to computing the estimation.,2008

2008papers/poster10.pdf,TIME ACTIVITIES AT THE BIPM E. F. Arias and G. Panfilo Bureau International des Poids et Mesures Time Frequency and Gravimetry Section Pavillon de Breteuil Sèvres Cedex F-92312 France E-mail: farias@bipm.org Abstract Almost 70 laboratories participate at present to the calculation of TAI and UTC at the,BIPM. Their contributions involve about 350 atomic clocks linked by various techniques. Significant progress has been made in time transfer for clock comparison at the BIPM in 2008 either in the routine calculation of Circular T or in studies tending to enhance the quality of the reference time scales. Most time links (70%) are computed from multi-channel GPS receivers either single- frequency or dual-frequency; 15% of the links from TWSTFT observations in Europe North America and the Asia-Pacific region. The section treats in total TW observations from 20 laboratories half of them not still included in the routine calculation but under study aiming at their inclusion. Studies on the use of TW for supporting GPS equipment calibration were undertaken and used for a particular link. Following the recommendation of the Consultative Committee for Time and Frequency (CCTF) in 2006 a pilot experiment whose aim is to regularly compute some TAI links with the Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technique was proposed to time laboratories. More than 20 laboratories participate in this experiment whose results are regularly published on the ftp server of the BIPM. GPS equipment calibration continued during the last year reports have been published and a Web page has been created to favor the dissemination among laboratories of results of calibrations and organization of future campaigns. Studies to analyze the influence of some types of atomic standards on TAI have started with the aim of investigating a new possible procedure for the frequency prediction of the hydrogen,2008
2008papers/poster05.pdf,TIME AND FREQUENCY ACTIVITIES AT THE U.S. NAVAL OBSERVATORY Demetrios Matsakis Time Service Department U.S. Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 USA Abstract The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) has provided timing for the Navy since 1830,and in cooperation with other institutions has also provided timing for the United States and the international community. Its Master Clock (MC) is the source of UTC (USNO) USNO’s realization of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) which has stayed within 5 ns rms of UTC since 1999 and within 3.1 ns rms in 2008. The data used to generate UTC (USNO) are based upon 70 cesium and 24 hydrogen maser frequency standards in four buildings at two sites. USNO disseminates time via voice telephone modem LORAN Network Time Protocol (NTP) GPS and Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT). This paper describes some of the changes being made to meet the future needs for precision accuracy and robustness.

Of these the largest group almost half the staff is directly involved in time transfer. The rest are fairly evenly divided between those who service the clocks those who monitor them and those who are working to develop new ones. The core stability of USNO time is based upon the clock ensemble. We currently have 69 HP5071 cesium clocks made by Hewlett-Packard/Agilent/Symmetricom and 24 cavity-tuned,2008
2008papers/paper31.pdf,USING SIGN PATTERNS TO DISTINGUISH FEARED CLOCK EVENTS Matthias Suess and Ulrich Grunert E-mail: Matthias.suess@dlr.de German Aerospace Centre (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen Germany Abstract The first and second difference of clock measurements is investigated to detect and identify clock events. A hypothesis test of the difference functions is described which is calibrated by,given Allan deviations of the observed clock differences. The impact of four defined clock events namely time step frequency step drift step and outlier on the first and second differences is calculated. The analysis outlines that the sign of these calculations generate a pattern of “1” ”0” and “-1” which are called event patterns. In order to identify the underlying event type the identification method interprets the detection process again as a sequence of “1” “0” and “-1” and maps the event patterns to the detection patterns. The detection and identification method are assessed by analyzing the time offset measurements between a commercial rubidium frequency standard and an active hydrogen maser. Both clocks are operated at the DLR timing laboratory.,2008

2008papers/paper27.pdf,FREQUENCY JUMP DETECTION AND ANALYSIS W. J. Riley Hamilton Technical Services 650 Distant Island Drive Beaufort SC 29907-1580 USA Tel.: 843-525-6495 E-Mail: bill@wriley.com Abstract The detection of jumps in a frequency record is a challenging problem by either visual or,mathematical means. The former takes considerable experience and judgment and is therefore quite subjective but has the advantage of providing insight into device behavior. The latter is more impartial and consistent and can be automated. In combination mathematical jump detection can be applied for automatic clock testing and monitoring. If a jump is detected the record can then be inspected visually before deciding on the action required. This paper describes frequency jump detection algorithms that are included in a program for frequency stability analysis.,2008

This support includes providing precise time and frequency to the integration and testing of new hardware frequency reference for spacecraft ranging and communications via the APL satellite communications facility and the time-stamping of ground-receipt telemetry packets from various spacecraft. The Lab’s ensemble of three high-performance cesium standards and three hydrogen masers are integrated to form the APL time scale which is the basis for estimating UTC – UTC (APL) and for evaluating the performance of our clocks. Traceability to USNO NIST and UTC is maintained via GPS common-view and all-in-view time transfer. The Lab’s clocks are also incorporated into the computation of International Atomic Time (TAI). 663 Mission Provide precise time and frequency in support of critical APL projects and maintain traceability to U.S. and international timing laboratories.,2008

2008papers/poster02.pdf,RESIDUAL VIBRATION-INDUCED PM NOISE OF A RIGID OPTICAL FIBER SPOOL 1 J. Taylor C. Nelson A. Hati N. Ashby and D. Howe National Institute of Standards and Technology 325 Broadway Boulder CO 80305 USA Abstract Oscillators operating in field applications are subject to much more strenuous,environmental effects than those in the laboratory. These environmental effects such as vibration and temperature fluctuation have a great impact on the performance of the oscillators; however many applications require this laboratory-level performance in situ. Opto-electronic oscillators (OEOs) have emerged in recent years as excellent low-noise sources that rival the best radio-frequency (RF) oscillators over broad offset frequencies. An OEO is a delay-line oscillator based on a long optical fiber wound on a spool. The OEO uses an RF-modulated optical signal transmitted down a long fiber-optic cable as a high-Q RF frequency discriminator. OEOs hold promise for many field applications requiring very low noise levels to maintain a high level of precise timing. The phase modulated (PM) noise of these OEOs at offset frequencies below 1 kHz is dominated by environmental effects such as temperature and vibration. This paper studies the impact of external environmental vibration on the optical fiber wound on a spool. Mechanical distortions in the fiber induce time-delay (phase) fluctuations. The spool onto which the fiber is wound is primarily responsible for imparting these vibration-induced delay fluctuations to the fiber and thus diminishing the performance of the OEO. In this paper we compare the vibration-induced phase fluctuations of a 3- km optical fiber wound on spools made of four materials—plastic foam-covered plastic ceramic and foam-covered ceramic. We investigate fiber-on-spool winding and mounting techniques that reduce vibration susceptibility. We present residual PM measurements that compare the vibration sensitivity of an optical fiber wound on these different materials. From this we give an,2008

2008papers/paper8.pdf,STANDARDIZING SPACE OVENIZED CRYSTAL OSCILLATORS FOR LOWER COST AND FASTER DELIVERY Jay Humphrey Liz Ronchetti and John Richardson Wenzel Associates Inc. 2215 Kramer Lane Austin TX 78758 USA Abstract Building for space is challenging. Program management requirements parts availability and delivery parts costs and testing costs historically make space OCXOs expensive and long-,lead. Standardizing specifications based on MIL-PRF-55310 NASA EEE-INST-002 NASA Parts Selection List and GSFC Preferred Parts Lists and procuring parts to vendors standard drawings can significantly reduce costs and improve delivery of high-performance OCXOs. Wenzel presents a discussion of parts materials and screening specifications for cost and delivery for three grades of OCXOs. Wenzel Associates builds high-performance very-low-noise oscillators frequency standards and synthesizers for military space and commercial requirements. Space oscillators have recently been completed for Los Alamos/NNSA the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter the Aquarius/SAC-D sea surveyor and TACSAT-4 for NASA. Wenzel’s oscillators were provided to the Mars Lander Mission for JPL the NEAR Earth Asteroid Rendezvous Satellite for Johns Hopkins APL and Northrop Grumman and NASA for the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS). Flight Models of the X-band synthesizer for the Mars Science Laboratory's landing radar for JPL were delivered this year.,2008

First we introduce the ground station equipment. Second we explain RESSOX control algorithm using the L1/L2/L5-band navigation signals of the QZSS and related experiments using the ground equipment. We focus on the selection priority of navigation signals for feedback control based on the signal quality estimated from the standard deviation of the pseudorange. If ionospheric delay is not considered the method that uses only L5Q navigation signal is the best. However if ionospheric delay is considered the combination of L1C/A L2CL and L5Q navigation signals is the best. Third we discuss a control method to be implemented during communication interruption that takes place for approximately 32 minutes twice a day. We examined an average of 100 control voltages (150 s) immediately before the communication interruption and were able to achieve a synchronization error of less than 5 ns. I.,2008
2008papers/paper23.pdf,STEERING A TIME SCALE Judah Levine Time and Frequency Division National Institute of Standards and Technology Boulder CO 80305 USA jlevine@boulder.nist.gov Abstract A time scale is a procedure for combining the data from an ensemble of clocks or frequency standards. The input data to the ensemble algorithm are generally the time (or frequency),differences between each of the members and the reference device for the system. Therefore the overall time and frequency of the ensemble are free parameters and must be continuously adjusted using external data and a steering algorithm. In addition the outputs of the procedure are the average time and frequency of the group and the characteristics of each device (time frequency frequency aging prediction error etc.) with respect to this average and a second job of the steering algorithm is to realize this computed average time and frequency in a physical device. I will discuss the considerations that govern the design of steering algorithms in general. I will illustrate these considerations using the algorithms that realize UTC (NIST) from the ensemble average of the time differences of the cesium standards and hydrogen masers that are located at the NIST laboratory in Boulder. I will also discuss the design of the steering of the backup for UTC (NIST) which is based on an ensemble of cesium standards located at the NIST radio station in Fort Collins. The backup time scale is intended to support the NIST services should the primary time scale become unavailable so that it must track UTC (NIST) as closely as possible which implies a tight coupling between the two scales. At the same time it must remain independent of UTC (NIST) so that it does not fail if its external reference becomes unavailable which implies a loose coupling. I will discuss the actual design which is a compromise between these two incompatible requirements.,2008
2008papers/paper37.pdf,INFLUENCE OF IONOSPHERE PERTURBATIONS IN GPS TIME AND FREQUENCY TRANSFER Sophie Pireaux Pascale Defraigne Nicolas Bergeot Quentin Baire and Carine Bruyninx Royal Observatory of Belgium Avenue Circulaire 3 B-1180 Brussels Belgium E-mail: sophie.pireaux@oma.be Abstract,The stability of GPS time and frequency transfer is limited by the fact that GPS signals travel through the ionosphere. In high-precision geodetic time transfer (i.e. based on precise modelling of code and carrier-phase GPS data) the so-called ionosphere-free combination of the code and carrier-phase measurements made on the two frequencies is used to remove the first-order ionosphere effect. In this paper we investigate the impact of residual second- and third-order ionosphere perturbations on geodetic time transfer solutions using the ATOMIUM software developed at the Royal Observatory of Belgium (ROB). The impact of third-order ionosphere effects was shown to be negligible while for second-order effects the tests performed on different time links and at different epochs show a small effect of the order of some picoseconds on a quiet day and up to more than 10 picoseconds in case of high ionosphere activity.,2008

2008papers/poster14.pdf,IMPROVEMENT OF THE TIME SCALE OF NPLI Suman Sharma P. Banerjee and Arundhati Chaterjee National Physical Laboratory New Delhi 110012 India E-mail: ssharma@nplindia.org Abstract The National Physical Laboratory India (NPLI) is responsible for maintenance and development of the Indian Standard Time (IST) and also contributes through the GPS network,to the generation of UTC coordinated by BIPM. The objective of the Time Unit is to implement a smoother timescale at NPLI. Recently NPLI has made some special efforts to improve the uncertainty between UTC and UTC (NPLI). One basic clock ensemble algorithm is implemented to make the timescale of UTC (NPLI) by combining the intercomparison data of five cesium clocks. Some initial tests have been carried out to check the validity of this algorithm and they observed a significant improvement in the UTC – UTC (NPLI) Circular T values and frequency offset with respect to UTC. This is necessary to judge the efficacy of the algorithm. A few iteration processes and/or some sort of modification may be anticipated to optimize the algorithm further. The output of the optimized process is normally fed to a micro- phase stepper to steer the timescale. Data from only one cesium is currently submitted to BIPM but the aim is to submit data from all five cesium atomic clocks to BIPM in the near future. NPLI also plans to take intercomparison data from the eight Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) cesium clocks. By optimally ensembling of these clocks and the addition of data from these clocks NPLI may generate an improved timescale. The uncertainty for the NPLI – PTB time link in Section 6 of BIPM Circular T is 2.5 ns for Type A and 7.0 ns for Type B giving a total uncertainty of 7.4 ns. If the NPLI TTS2 receiver is calibrated on-site at NPLI by a travelling calibration BIPM receiver then the Type B uncertainty may be reduced further to 5.0 ns. Various efforts are underway to improve the uncertainty U,2008
2008papers/paper34.pdf,GPS RECEIVER PERFORMANCE TEST AT ROA Hector Esteban Juan Palacio Francisco Javier Galindo and Jorge Garate Real Instituto y Observatorio de la Armada 11100 San Fernando Spain E-mail: hesteban@roa.es Abstract Real Instituto y Observatorio de la Armada (ROA) carries out daily intercomparisons of time and frequency using the GPS satellite system. For this type of links and for high-precision global comparisons the use of geodesic GPS receivers is highly recommended because it,provides the solution using code P1/P2 (P3) and also carrier phase (PPP). ROA has been operating two different class of these receivers: PolaRx2 (developed by Septentrio Belgium) since 2005 and GTR50 (developed by DICOM Czech Republic) since 2006 . Although the last one was initially developed for time and frequency comparisons using the GPS Common View C/A method this receiver can perform code and phase measurements and after the issue of the last software version it has provided the possibility of solution in carrier phase. In this paper we present the comparison results of three GTR50 receivers in two different setups: common clock and zero baseline. Also comparison with PolaRx2 data are shown and analyzed.,2008
2008papers/paper20.pdf,SYNCHRONIZATION IN PACKET NETWORKS: TIMING METRICS AND MONITORING Charles Barry and Srinivas Bangalore Brilliant Telecommunications 307 Orchard City Drive San Jose CA 95008 USA E-mail: srinivas@brillianttelecom.com Abstract,Packet Delay Variation (PDV) is a major impediment to transferring timing from a source (Master/Server) to destination (Slave/Client) over a packet-switched network. PDV directly affects frequency alignment (syntonization) and asymmetry of PDV impacts time alignment (phase). There is considerable interest in the industry to establish a relationship between PDV and the ability to recover time/phase/frequency via a packet-based method (e.g. PTP NTP). Recent developments in PDV analysis have indicated that it is feasible to build accurate models of network behavior under varying conditions of load number of switches forwarding algorithms QoS implementation and so on. It has also been shown that no single metric (e.g. TDEV minTDEV) is sufficient to characterize PDV and that a suite of metrics is necessary. Study of PDV also develops intuition and permits heuristic approaches to be devised that use nonlinear processing to filtering of the PDV greatly enhancing the performance of clock recovery compared to linear PLL methods. In this presentation Brilliant will provide experimental results and demonstrate that: (1) Practice does indeed have relationship to theory. Proper measurements are indeed consistent repeatable and significantly predictable; (2) Proper heuristics and multiple metrics provide high-quality clock recovery and knowledge of the transport layer (e.g. GigE xDSL) can be applied to improve performance. 197,2008

TL has already set up a prototype system for this purpose. The stability and accuracy of a DUT (device under test) at a remote site with traceability to TL’s frequency standard could be obtained after data processing. The prototype system includes the master site (herein at TL) and the remote site. At the remote site the equipped GPS receiver runs with a DUT as its frequency reference. By performing the time difference (differences between two epochs) on carrier-phase observations the DUT’s frequency offset with respect to the GPS frequency standard can be estimated. At the master site the GPS receiver is referenced to TL’s frequency standard and the time difference and carrier-phase single difference (differences between two receivers at TL and the remote site) are performed at postprocessing. The frequency offset of the DUT relative to TL’s frequency standard can be estimated in this way. Observations from the remote site could be sent to TL via the Internet. As for the system arrangement the IGS (International GPS Service) site TWTF at TL serves as the master site and a single-frequency GPS receiver is adopted at the remote site to cost down expenses of system set up. Data analysis is done by the lab-developed software. A common- clock short-baseline test (using TL’s frequency standard) and a 270-km baseline test (using a high-performance 5071A cesium clock as the remote frequency reference) were carried out to find the system’s performance. In the 270-km baseline test a dual-frequency GPS receiver was,2008

The new modem is based on software-defined radio technology. Transmission and reception of signals between distinct ground stations are based on a pseudo-random noise code similar to the one used for GALILEO or GPS’s modernized ranging signal. Our developed signal is introduced by a pair of pseudo-random noise codes that are separated in the frequency domain. The advantage of this signal is that the operational costs are below those of conventional signals but yield better precision. We have recently carried out Two-Way Time Transfer experiment using the new signal. For evaluation of time transfer precision GPS observations have been taken at the same time. Results show that the measurement precision of the new signal is better than 100 ps and clock behavior of two stations was found to be consistent compared with GPS carrier-phase time transfer.,2008

1999papers/paper10.pdf,WIDE AREA AUGMENTATION SYSTEM (WAAS) D. Orrnand Director of Operations Raytheon WAAS Program Office Fullerton CA Abstract Global Positioning System (GPS) navigation signals alone are not adequate to support aviation navigation. GPS accuracy is acceptable for all but precision,approach applications but integrity continui& and availability are lacking. Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) hardware has been installed and used for testing since hrst summer. Wide Area Reference Stations receive GPS signals and forward them to Wide Area Master Stations for corrections processing. Augmentation messages are sent to the Ground Uplink Stations for transmission to Geosynchronous (CEO) satellites that retransmit the messages to avionics receivers in aircraft. WAAS is a safety critical system meaning time to alarm is critical and transmission of hazardously misleading information is not allowed. Phase I WAAS will be commissioned in September of next year and will provide enroute through non-precision approach services throughout the US Flight Information Region. Precision approach services will be provided over roughly 50% of the continental US. END-state WAAS will provide CAT-l precision approach navigation service throughout the continental US. The key to all WAAS operations is time. The GPS satellites the GE0 satellites and all WAAS hardware suites must agree upon time. Precision time has been identified as one of the major untapped byproducts of WAAS.,1999

2013papers/Peil-LPI-Invariance.pdf,RAPID COMMUNICATIONS,PHYSICAL REVIEW A 87 010102(R) (2013) Tests of local position invariance using continuously running atomic clocks Steven Peil Scott Crane † James L. Hanssen Thomas B. Swanson and Christopher R. Ekstrom United States Naval Observatory Washington DC 20392 (Received 11 December 2012; published 22 January 2013) Tests of local position invariance (LPI) made by comparing the relative redshift of atomic clocks based on different atoms have been carried out for a variety of pairs of atomic species. In most cases several absolute frequency measurements per year are used to look for an annual signal resulting in tests that can span on order of a decade. By using the output of continuously running clocks we carry out LPI tests with comparable or higher precision after less than 1.5 years. These include new measurements of the difference in redshift anomalies β for hyperﬁne transitions in 87 Rb and,2013
