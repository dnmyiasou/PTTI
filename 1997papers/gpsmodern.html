<br> <b>GPS Modernization - Request for User Input
<br> Wednesday, December 3
<br> 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm </b>
</center>
<br>
<br>     The March 1996 Presidential Decision Directive on U.S. GPS 
Policy recognized GPS as an integral part of the "Global Information 
Infrastructure" with a broad range of military, civil, commercial and 
scientific interests, both national and international.  The U.S. 
government is seeking civilian sector input into a Future Worldwide 
Positioning, Velocity, and Timing System Capstone Requirements Document 
to address the near, mid, and far term modernization of the GPS.
<br>
<br>    A side-session will be held <b>December 3, from 7:00 pm until 
9:00 pm </b> during the <b>1997 Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) 
Systems and Applications Meeting </b> to gather additional timing 
requirements regarding the GPS Modernization.
<br>
