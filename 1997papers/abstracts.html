<br>ABSTRACT
</b></center>
<br>
TriNet is a collaborative project of the California Institute of
Technology, the California Division of Mines and Geology, and the U.S.
Geological Survey to develop a digital seismographic network in southern
California.  TriNet will provide ground motion data having unprecedented
frequency bandwidth and dynamic range from more than 600 stations
located throughout southern California, including urbanized areas.  All
stations will have 3-component, high-dynamic-range, strong-motion force
balance accelerometers.  In addition, all stations will have either real-time
or dial-up digital telemetry.  Of the total 600 stations more than 200 of
these will also have high-gain seismometers for measuring very small
ground motions.  Major products of the TriNet project are: 1) near-real-time 
monitoring and cataloging of earthquakes in southern California, 2)
broad-band ground motions from distant earthquakes and other seismic
sources, 3) strong-motion recordings from significant earthquakes in
southern California, 4) near-real-time shaking intensity maps for
emergency management, and 5) a pilot system for early warning of seismic
shaking.  Many other agencies (e.g., lifeline operators, emergency
management agencies, etc.) are being included in the development of
TriNet.  TriNet will provide an unprecedented new capabilities to
understand and to respond to earthquakes in southern California.

<br><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
</center>
<br>
	The conditions of computation of TAI and UTC are in constant
evolution. Since January 1996, access to TAI and UTC has been provided
for the MJDs ending in 4 and 9, which corresponds to an update period
of 5 days for these reference time scales instead of 10 days as was
previously done. The replacement of clocks of older design by new ones
of the HP5071A type, started in 1993, continues with consequent
improvement in the stability of the free atomic time scale EAL, the first
step in the calculation of TAI. The medium-term stability of EAL,
expressed in terms of the Allan standard deviation <sub>y</sub>, is 
estimated to be 1.0&#215;10<sup>15</sup> for averaging times of between 
1 and 2 months, a scale attribute of fundamental importance for institutions 
charged with the dissemination of real-time times scales.
<br><br>
	To further improve the stability of EAL and to further reduce the 
delay of access to TAI and UTC, the algorithm which produces them may need
to be revised. With this in view, experiments on real clock data collected
at the BIPM have been carried out to show the advantage of simultaneously
using an upper limit on relative weights rather then one on absolute
weights, and a basic interval of computation of one month, rather than one
of two months. Results of these tests are positive, so the BIPM reported on
these studies to the Working group on TAI of the Comit&eacute; Consultatif pour
la D&eacute;finition de la Seconde (CCDS) in view of implementing consequent
changes in 1998. A decision is being made.

<br><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
</center>
<br>
	The Working Party 7A (WP-7A) on "Time Signals and Frequency
Standard Emissions" is one of the four Working Parties of Study Group 7
"Science Services" (SG 7) of the Radiocommunication Sector of the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU-R). The subjects which are
addressed in the WP-7A meetings on the basis of input documents as
solutions to Questions are: (world wide) Standard F/T dissemination from
terrestrial transmitters and from satellites including GPS, GLONASS and
Two-Way Satellite T/F transfer, time codes, requirements for high
precision time, performance of T/F standards, time scale stability
characterization, signal delays in antennas and other circuits, time delay
measurement and compensation methods in SDH/Sonet systems, etc. The
results of the discussions during the meetings are presented preferably in
the form of ITU-R Recommendations to the more than 190 ITU Member
states.
<br><br>
	For the purpose of communication of the best use and selection of
Frequency and Time Systems to a wide group of users, the writing of
handbooks in WP-7A has been started with contributions from
internationally recognized specialists. The first handbook (Dr. R. Sydnor
as main editor and D.W. Allan as co-editor) is entitled "Handbook
Selection and Use of Precise Frequency and Time Systems," ISBN 92-61-06511-2 (it is available at CHF 50 at ITU in Geneva: teleph. +41 22 730
6141,<strong> </strong>fax +41 22 730 5194, e-mail sales@itu.int, info at<u>

<br><strong>IS TAI ACCURACY DEGRADING?</strong>
<br>

<br>
<br><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
</center>
<br>
	To characterize the accuracy of TAI, estimates are made of the 
relative departure (and of its uncertainty) of the duration of the TAI 
scale interval from the SI second as produced on the rotating geoid by 
primary frequency standards. The global treatment of measurements provided 
by individual standards led to a relative departure of 
2.6&#215;10<sup>14</sup> with an uncertainty of 1.0&#215;10<sup>14</sup> 
for March-April 1997.
<br><br>
	This relative departure is larger than that resulting from uniform
application of the correction for the black-body radiation frequency shift
(about 2&#215;10<sup>14</sup>) in 1995, for which a procedure for compensation 
was applied immediately and still continues (cumulative frequency steering
corrections, each of relative amplitude 1 to 2&#215;10<sup>15</sup> applied 
on dates separated by 60 day intervals). Current results suggest that this 
procedure did not even compensate for the apparent drift of the scale, 
observed by comparison with the continuously operating primary standard 
PTB CS2. This procedure should thus be reinforced, but without degrading the
middle-term stability of the scale estimated to <sub><em>y</em></sub>
( = 40 d) = 1&#215;10<sup>15</sup>.
<br><br>
	The uncertainty of the relative departure of the duration of the TAI
scale interval from the SI second on the rotating geoid is also larger than
that expected from a global treatment of measurements provided by the
best primary frequency standards, the standard uncertainties of which are
sometimes in the low fifteens. This results from the estimates of TAI
accuracy being based mainly on the measurements obtained from one 
single primary frequency standard, PTB CS2: unfortunately, since July
1996, the optically pumped frequency standard NIST-7 has provided only
one measurement, no data has been available from the BNM-LPTF
fountain FO1, and large frequency steps made data from PTB CS3
unusable. This situation is the worst we have experienced since 1994 and
1995 when five accurate primary frequency standards were in operation
(PTB CS1, CS2, CS3, NIST-7 and LPTF-FO1), and before 1994 data were
available from two standards (PTB CS1 and PTB CS2).
<br><br>
	It follows that the BIPM does not receive a sufficient number of
measurements from primary frequency standards for a safe estimation of
the accuracy of TAI and of its evolution with time. The degradation of the
accuracy of TAI may thus be only apparent. Results from new caesium
fountains under development in a number of laboratories may help solve 
this problem.

<br><strong>RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN DRIFT COEFFICIENTS </strong>
<br><strong>UNCERTAINTIES AND NOISE LEVELS: </strong>
<br><strong>APPLICATION TO TIME ERROR PREDICTION</strong>

<br>
Oscillators are affected by drifts (linear phase drifts, linear frequency
drift, i.e. quadratic phase drift) and different types of noise according 
to the power law model of power spectral density (from f<sup>-2</sup> to 
f <sup>2</sup> frequency noise, i.e. f<sup>-4</sup> to f<sup>0</sup> phase 
noise). Generally, for long term instability characterization (duration 
greater than one hour), drifts coefficients are estimated by using least 
squares whereas noise levels are obtained from the residuals by using 
variances (AVAR, MVAR, TVAR, ...).
<br><br>
	However, the low frequency noises, such as random walk FM, induce
very long term fluctuations which may be confused with deterministic
drifts. This effect, due to the non-stationarity of these noises, depends on
the low cut-off frequency which must be introduced in order to insure
power convergence for low frequencies. But, the real physical meaning of
such a cut-off frequency is mysterious. In this paper, we propose another
approach for the characterization of low frequency noises, considering a
random walk FM as the integration of a white process since the setting up
of the oscillator. We also calculate the standard deviation of "artificial"
drifts due to long term random fluctuations, versus the noise levels.
<br><br>
	The primary interest of these results concerns the estimation of the
measurement uncertainty of drift coefficient: knowing the noise levels of
an oscillator we calculate the standard deviation of the artificial drift
coefficient due to these noises; thus, if a "real" deterministic drift is
identified in the signal, its coefficients are determined plus or minus the  
artificial drift.  The standard deviation of the artificial drift coefficients
may be considered as the measurement uncertainty of the deterministic
drift coefficient.
<br><br>
	The secondary interest concerns the predictability of an oscillator
affected by a deterministic drift. The reliability of a prediction depends on
two factors:
<blockquote>
	-- the relevancy of the model,
<br>	-- the accuracy of the parameter determination.
</blockquote>

	Thus, the knowledge of the drift coefficient uncertainties yields a
criterion for quantifying the reliability of a time error prediction.

<br><strong>TOTAL VARIANCE: A PROGRESS REPORT ON A NEW </strong>
<br><strong>FREQUENCY STABILITY CHARACTERIZATION</strong>

<br><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>
</center>
<br>
	We present results of recent work on a newly developed frequency
stability characterization, called Total variance, whose main advantages are
improved confidence at and near the longest averaging time of tau=T/2,
where T=data duration, and lower sensitivity to drift removal. By theory
and simulation we compute its mean, variance, and probability distribution;
in particular, we report its variance at tau=T/2 for the FM noises, and
express the result as degrees of freedom. In the presence of white FM noise
modulation, Total variance is an unbiased estimate of the Allan variance
for all tau, and has three degrees of freedom at tau=T/2. We also find that
simple bias formulas can be used in the presence of flicker FM and random
walk FM.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We discuss Total variance's properties as a random variable that is
functionally dependent on both tau and T, as contrasted with the theoretical
Allan variance, which depends only on tau and whose conventional
estimators are limited to tau&lt;=T/2 for a phase record of duration T. In
principle, Total variance can report values beyond the usual Allan variance
last-tau value of tau=T/2; its values at tau&gt;T/2 might be used to augment
the normal last-tau value of frequency stability reported at tau=T/2.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We compute the frequency response of Total variance as a function of
tau by averaging the squares of the Fourier transforms of Total variance
sampling functions, and find that it resembles the frequency response of
Allan variance. The results of these investigations indicate that Total
variance, while it has an interpretation like that of the Allan variance, also
has lower variability and less sensitivity to drift removal.

<br>
<p>	A compact Space borne Hydrogen Maser (SHM) frequency standard
is being developed by the Observatory of Neuch&acirc;tel (ON). The
development is sponsored by the Swiss PRODEX program of ESA. The
SHM-RA instrument will be flown on the Radioastron I (RA-I) mission in
1999 to be used as the reference clock for orbital Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) and for the red-shift experiment CRONOS.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The stability of the hydrogen maser is close to 
1&#215;10<sup>-15</sup> in a range of averaging times from 1000 s to 
10000 s. Potential space applications of a compact active hydrogen maser 
instrument include scientific experiments related to relativity, precise 
ranging and navigation, time dissemination and synchronization.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The SHM-RA design is based on a miniature sapphire loaded
microwave cavity which makes possible an active hydrogen maser with a
1.7 litre storage volume for atomic hydrogen within a 50 kg space qualified
instrument.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The first atomic signal was obtained from the fully integrated
Prototype Engineering Model of the Physics Package (PEM-PP) in
December 1996. An extensive design verification test program of the PEM-PP 
is now in progress and will be completed in 1997.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	In the paper, the Radioastron Space VLBI experiment, the CRONOS
red-shift experiment and the development and design of the SHM-RA
instrument shall be outlined. The main contribution of this paper shall be
a report of the design verification test program performed on the PEM-PP.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The microwave cavity and magnetic shields assembly, i.e. the heart of
the PP, is the most complicated and delicate piece of hardware in the SHM-RA 
instrument. It has been tested successfully in random vibration (20 Hz
to 2000 Hz, 7.5 g rms) and for shocks (40 g) to the Radioastron
qualification levels in May 1997. A Finite Element Structural Model of the
SHM-RA instrument was developed in Switzerland under an industrial
contract with PRODEX as part of the design verification program. The
measured operating atomic quality factor is 1.5&#215;10<sup>9</sup>. Only 
7.5 W of electrical power is necessary for the active thermal regulation of 
the PP in air at room temperature. These and other significant test results 
shall be reported in the paper.

<br wp="br1">
<p>	Much research has been conducted on GPS integrity during the last
few years. Nevertheless, only a few studies deal with long-term
experimental evaluation and none of them consider timing receivers.
Moreover, typical integrity-dependent applications like civil aviation
usually only require (at least) one "certified" positioning/timing datum
within a certain time interval. More stringent requirements, however, apply
when GPS receivers are used as the sole means for establishing a common
notion of time in fault-tolerant distributed real-time systems. In this case,
not even a single erroneous timing datum should occur or escape detection.
Reasoning about such GPS applications requires knowledge of the
erroneous behavior of any timing datum provided by a GPS receiver;
something that cannot be inferred from integrity reports.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Therefore, when we started our project SynUTC on external clock
synchronization in fault-tolerant distributed real-time systems, we decided
to conduct some experiments of our own to justify our undertaking and to
facilitate fault modeling. A continuous experimental evaluation of six
commercially available GPS timing receivers was eventually performed
from December 12, 1995 to February 15, 1996. This paper provides an
overview of the whole setup and presents the most important results
obtained from the analysis of the 778 MB of sampled data.

<p>	The U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) uses the AOA TWT-100 Atlantis
modem for most of its Two-Way Satellite Time Transfer (TWSTT)
applications. A method was devised to measure delay changes versus 
temperature in an operational monitoring system. The VSAT on the roof
of the USNO Bldg. 78 (VSOR) is a 1.8 meter dish used as the primary
operational antenna for TWSTT with the Alternate Master Clock (AMC)
in Colorado Springs. The Mobil Earth Station (MES) monitors the (VSOR)
performance with six experiments per day. As long as the hardware
remains unchanged, a constant difference should result. 
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The MES and VSOR are essentially co-located about 100 ft. apart with
a common clock reference. Temperature measurements were taken using
the thermocouple-based temperature measuring system. The thermocouple
probes used to monitor the temperature of the modem are located on top of
each AOA modem in the MES and in the Bldg. 78 laboratory  room.

<p>	In early 1989 the first Block II Global Positioning System (GPS)
satellites were launched, marking the beginning of the second phase of the
GPS program. The satellites were designed for a seven-and-one-half year
lifespan and a six year mean mission duration. Launched in March of 1990,
SVN 20 was the seventh of the Block II GPS satellites. On 11 May 1996,
SVN 20 was set permanently unhealthy to users after being operational for
just over six years. Due to degradation of the Attitude Velocity and Control
Subsystem (AVCS), SVN 20 was no longer capable of maintaining the
stable, earth-pointing platform necessary to perform the GPS navigation
mission. However, through intensive maintenance by personnel at the
Master Control Station (MCS) at Falcon Air Force Base, it was possible to
stabilize the vehicle long enough to perform extensive end-of-life testing
on the four on-board atomic frequency standards. These tests on both the
cesium and rubidium frequency standards varied in duration and
complexity.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	Of the four frequency standards, one had been operational for five
months, two had been used previously, but were since off-line for two years
and four years, respectively, and one had never been initialized. Areas of 
interest for the rubidium clocks included the determination of the
temperature  coefficient, voltage controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO)
open-loop operations, and measurement of the C-field and VCXO tuning 
ranges. For the cesium frequency standards, the tests focused on Ramsey
pattern generation, gain determination through loop time constant
measurement, and C-field and VCXO performance degradation.
<p>	All four clocks were still operational at various levels of performance
and accuracy. the results of these tests were encouraging in that they
supported conclusions made during the SVN 9 and SVN 10 (Block I) end-of-life 
testing. It is hoped these results will be useful to the GPS clock
community as observations of performance characteristics of space-based
atomic frequency standards.

<p>	It is well known that the classical N-sample variance of mean
frequency is dependent on the measurement duration, T, and does not
converge for common kinds of random frequency instabilities as the data
duration T gets longer. Instead, the recommendation is to report the square
root of the two-sample (Allan) variance which is an RMS of first-differences 
of average frequencies taken sequentially. These coefficients are therefore 
the average frequency change vs. averaging time (tau), hence are a "tau domain"
result but are commonly referred to as "time-domain frequency stability." A 
shortfall of these coefficients is that they are highly variable at large tau 
and hence difficult to interpret, especially if drift has been removed.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	A new frequency-stability characterization called Total variance was
introduced in 1994 which yields coefficients that can be directly interpreted
like the Allan variance but with better confidence and less sensitivity to the
method of drift removal. Total variance is in a different class of transforms
to the tau domain in that it responds like a two-sample variance but its
sampling of average frequency changes with tau in relation to T. Its square
root (or Total deviation) is therefore not an RMS. Rather, Total variance is
a random variable, that is, the one-shot  result of an individual
measurement dependent on tau and T instead of only tau as in the case of 
the theoretical Allan variance.  Total variance can report values beyond the
usual last-tau value of tau=T/2. In this paper, we discuss the relationship of
Total variance to the classical N-sample variance. The coefficients beyond
tau=T/2 are generally ignored, however we find that in fact all coefficients
in Total variance exactly synthesizes twice the classical sample standard
variance in contrast to the Allan variance which does not. This matrix result
is not dependent on noise type. To this end, the assumptions using total
variance are further validated.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	We show how one can include all long-term Total variance coefficients
into the last value usually reported, namely tau=T/2. By using the entirety
of the Total variance, the familiar tau-domain frequency stability
characterization becomes an exact analysis of the sample variance. This
means that summing all the points in a Total variance plot will lead to
exactly twice the sample variance much in the  same way that integrating
an estimate of a spectrum also yields the sample variance. We demonstrate
these concepts by comparing Total variance to the Allan variance using
data of NIST-7 versus a hydrogen maser.

ABSTRACT

<br wp="br2">
<p>	Precise time transfer experiments using GPS with time stabilities 
under ten nanoseconds are commonly being reported within the time transfer
community. Relative calibrations are done by measuring the time error of
one GPS receiver versus a "known master reference receiver." This relative
calibration can produce very stable results, but this begs the question of
"how does one calibrate the master reference GPS receiver." In this paper
we will discuss the use of advanced GPS simulators to measure the
absolute time error of GPS receivers. This method has the advantage of
calibrating a GPS receiver independent of any GPS system biases. The use
of a GPS simulator also allows testing of special conditions of the GPS
system, such as year 2000 rollover and the 1024 week epoch rollover.

ABSTRACT
</b></center>

<br wp="br2">
<p>	A Motorola Oncore 8-channel GPS C/A-code receiver has been
successfully tested for time meteorology applications, particularly in the
one-channel mode. During all these tests, raw observations were corrected
by the built-in Motorola software. This method of correction was always
considered temporary, however, because it allows only a partial application
of the standards adopted for accurate time transfer.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	To progress further we have developed software which rigorously
respects standards adopted by the CCDS sub-group on GPS and GLONASS
Time Transfer Standards (CGGTTS). This required the extraction of raw
pseudo-ranges at a rate of one per second, which were corrected for
geometrical delay, ionospheric and tropospheric delays, Sagnac effects,
periodic relativistic correction due to the eccentricity of the GPS satellite's
orbit, L1-L2 broadcast correction, and instrumental delays. As our software
runs on a PC, this provides the flexibility needed for future upgrades.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The software, which was first successfully tested on one-channel
observations, was next extended for 8-channel `all-in-view' 13-minute
tracks at standard hours. Our tests give the same or better performance,
than the Motorola built-in software.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	This paper outlines the principal features of the software and provides
a detailed analysis of its use for multi-channel common-view time transfer
on various baselines.

ABSTRACT
</b></center>
<br wp="br2">
<p>	This paper describes the development and testing of enhanced time
transfer processing software for the Motorola VP Oncore single frequency
eight channel GPS receiver.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The processing software as developed generates a separate
pseudorange residual for each satellite tracked, referred to a local time
scale with outputs calculated each second. The software provides outputs
in three different formats:
<blockquote>
  1. 13-minute averages for satellites matching the published BIPM
tracking schedule;
<br>  2. five minute averages arranged in the ENSEMBLE history file
format for all satellites tracked; and
<br>  3. raw 1 pps measurements for all satellites tracked.
</blockquote>

<p>The data can be transmitted automatically every day up to 20 recipients
using standard e-mail.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The system as configured utilizes the Oncore receiver, an external time
interval counter directly interfaced to the PC bus and a standard PC. The
processing and multicast auto e-mailer software run in the Windows 95
operating system and would also run with minor changes in a number of
other PC-based operating systems.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The receiver prototypes have been tested in short baseline common-view 
operation with the NIST standard receiver. The time difference between Oncore 
data (averaged according to the BIPM method to produce 13 minute tracks) and 
the NIST receiver is characterized by white phase noise with a magnitude of 
2.7 ns RMS. Additional tests including sensitivity to temperature and 
common-view measurements using all satellites in view are planned.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	The development effort is currently underway at NIST and is based on
work started at Hewlett - Packard Laboratories. It is intended to provide a
stable accurate low cost time transfer receiver for various applications
which include the cooperative USNO-NIST Time Scale Test Bed (TSTB).
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>The TSTB will be initially established in the first quarter of 1998 with
a network of six participating sites equipped with identical Oncore
receivers exchanging common-view data daily via the Internet.

ABSTRACT
</b></center>
<br wp="br2">
<p>Apart from the satellite terminal and the availability of a satellite link
the modem is the most important component for two-way satellite time and
frequency transfer (TWSTFT) operation. A breakthrough for TWSTFT was
the development of the MITREX-modem using spread-spectrum
techniques and enabling the use of small satellite terminals (VSATs) to
access communication satellites. The MITREX-modem established a kind
of standard for TWSTFT. Unfortunately it did not provide frequency agility
essential for the use with inexpensive VSATs, and it lacked a computer
interface for automated operation. The ATLANTIS-modem, which was for
years the only available modem after the production of the MITREX-modem 
was stopped, is not compatible with the MITREX-modem. The
now available SATRE-modem, to some extent a descendant of the
MITREX-modem, provides full compatibility with the MITREX-modem
and a lot of valuable features like frequency agility, data transfer capability,
and the implementation of different chip-rates. The development of the
modem by TIME-TECH was carried out in close contact with the Technical
University Graz (TUG).
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	After a brief description of the SATRE-modem and of the test
environment available at the TUG, measurement results obtained for
laboratory tests and for tests using satellite links and collocated earth
stations are presented and the performance of the SATRE-modem
compared with the MITREX-modem is discussed.

ABSTRACT

<br wp="br2">
The objective of this paper is to provide updated information on the
performance of the Milstar rubidium frequency standards to the PTTI
audience.  Four frequency standards, one primary and three backups, have
been in orbit and the primary unit has been in operation for two years.  
This paper presents the most recent information on these standards and some
interesting observations.  The performance of the Milstar satellite is
dependent on both time and frequency accuracy.  Satellite time is compared
to a cesium standard at the ground control station.  Time error is observed
and satellite time is periodically corrected.  Similarly, the rate of time 
error is observed and satellite frequency is periodically corrected. Frequency
is not directly observable and analysis is performed to determine the
performance of the standard.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	This paper will show that the primary atomic frequency standard is
operating after two years and drift has continuously improved into the
range of 1x10<sup>-13</sup> per day.  Telemetry has always been important on 
the Milstar satellite and the history of several key telemetry points (such 
as VCXO voltage, C-field and lamp intensity) will be presented.  Short-term
aberrations in the analyzed frequency data have been noted and have been
correlated to other phenomena such as 1) leap-second corrections, 2)
change of cesium reference at ground station, and 3) temperature variations
associated with eclipse periods every March and September.  Interestingly, 
recent frequency data (Summer 1997) implies that this rubidium standard
has been drifting positively (higher frequency) for the last 7 months. 
Updated information (including August 1997 data) and analysis on this
trend will be presented at the conference.

ABSTRACT

<br wp="br2">
The first successfully-launched Block IIR GPS navigation satellite was
placed in orbit on July 22, 1997 carrying the first three of a new generation
of rubidium clocks.  Since then, two of these clocks have been activated,
and both are performing well.  This paper will report on those early results,
and compare the in-orbit performance with ground test data.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
EG&amp;G has delivered about two-thirds of the 66 Rubidium Atomic
Frequency Standards (RAFS) units needed for the Block IIR GPS program. 
Each of the 21 Block IIR space vehicles has three RAFS.  Two RAFS are
undergoing ground life testing at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory
(NRL), and one unit is a spare.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
A summary of the acceptance test stability and aging data will be presented 
for all the delivered units, and more detailed acceptance test data will be 
shown for the three RAFS that are on-board SVN43.  In addition, similar life 
test data will be provided for the two units that have been running under 
thermovac conditions at NRL since April 1997.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
In-orbit stability and drift data will be presented for RAFS S/N 005 and
006 using all available 15-minute precise ephemeris/clock data from the
National Imaging and Mapping Agency (NIMA).  RAFS S/N 006 was turned on 
on 8/13/97 and was used as the active clock until 9/26/97.  RAFS S/N 005 
was turned on on 8/22/97 and became the active clock on 9/26/97 at the 
beginning of a 2-month extended navigation test.  Thus it is expected
that over one month of data will be available for each unit by the time of
this early report of the PTTI community.

ABSTRACT

<br wp="br2">
We discuss a filtering technique for reducing the frequency fluctuations 
of noise sources localized in space (like the troposphere, or the master 
clock) that affect the sensitivity of spacecraft Doppler tracking searches 
for gravitational radiation.  This method takes advantage of the sinusoidal 
behavior of the transfer function to the Doppler observable of these noise 
sources, which display sharp nulls at selected Fourier components.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The non-zero gravitational wave signal remaining at these frequencies makes 
this Doppler tracking technique the equivalent of a series of narrow-band 
detectors of gravitational radiation, distributed across the low-frequency 
band. Estimates for the sensitivities achievable with the future Cassini 
Doppler tracking experiments are presented in the contest of broad-band 
gravitational wave bursts, monochromatic signals, and a stochastic
background of gravitational radiation.

Historically, one of the main goals of the 2nd Space Operations
Squadron (2 SOPS) in maintaining the GPS constellation has been to
achieve the best possible system accuracy. the Master Control Station
(MCS) Kalman filter plays a key role in meeting this goal. Through a
process known as <em>tuning</em>, the database values which control the Kalman
filter operation are optimized to provide the best possible estimation and
prediction. Over the years, a series of in-house efforts have dramatically
improved the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of the GPS signal. The
latest iteration of these efforts is called the Ephemeris Enhancement
Endeavor (EEE).
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Air Force and contractor personnel have concentrated on two main
areas as part of the EEE: Kalman filter tuning and deterministic models.
Early results of this effort demonstrate a 15% reduction in ranging errors
and a 10% reduction in time transfer errors. The authors will present
descriptions of each area investigated, explain how the new tuning
parameters were derived, and provide detailed results of their efforts to

ABSTRACT
</b></center>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The two closely linked missions of the Global Positioning System
(GPS) are providing precise positioning for navigation accuracy and
precise time transfer. Positioning has typically received the most attention;
however, the ability to derive a precise position depends on having a stable
and reliable time scale as a starting point. Throughout the history of GPS,
its time scale has slowly evolved through many phases. The most
significant change came with the introduction of the Composite Clock in
1990. Additionally, in recent years the 2nd Space Operations Squadron (2
SOPS) has tuned the Composite Clock to take better advantage of its
contributing timing sources. In addition to reviewing the Composite
Clock's tuning history, the authors will discuss the recent implementation
of unique tuning for each of the GPS monitor station frequency standards.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
As pointed out in a previous paper regarding satellite clock-unique
tuning no two satellite frequency standards exhibit the same performance.
This also holds true for monitor station frequency standards. However,
other factors must be considered when deriving process noise values
(tuning parameters) for ground system contributors to the Composite
Clock. Mainly because the values chosen for each clock determine the size
of its vote in contributing to GPS time, one must look not only at clock 
performance, but  environmental factors as well. An excellent clock placed
in an environment with significant temperature and humidity fluctuations
can be very detrimental to GPS time if that clock is weighted heavily in the
Composite.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
This newly adopted concept of representing monitor station clocks
based on individual performance and environmental history has
significantly improved the stability and reliability of GPS Time. The
authors discuss several examples that reveal the robustness of the new
tuning as well as the current implicit long-term weighting given to each
frequency standard that contributes to the Composite Clock.

ABSTRACT
</b></center>
<br wp="br2">
The comparisons between the reference clocks maintained in timekeeping 
laboratories is based worldwide on the GPS signals reception according 
to the common view technique.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The increased accuracy and stability of the new commercial cesium clocks 
and of the laboratory frequency standards, require an improvement in the 
uncertainty of the synchronization links used.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
One of the most limiting factors in achieving this goal with the systems
actually in use, seems to be related to the ionospheric correction models
adopted in the one-channel, single frequency GPS receivers, normally
operated in the timing centers. Having the capability to access a data base
of Receiver Independent Exchange (RINEX) files, where the pseudo-range,
carrier-phase data and navigation messages provided by dual-frequency
GPS receivers of the Italian geodetic network are made available, some
investigations on the influence of the ionospheric delay corrections on the
GPS results have been performed at IEN.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
After having compared some existing models for the computation of
the Total Electron Content (TEC) using the data obtained by an ionosonde, 
in the direction of the different GPS satellites tracked by a geodetic
receiver, the investigation on the improvement obtainable applying
ionospheric delay corrections to the single-frequency receivers results, has
been performed solely through the data provided by the geodetic receivers.
For this purpose, the differential hardware delay of the L1 and L2 carriers
had to be computed for every geodetic receiver and satellite tracked using
an original approach, developed at IROE, based on the minimization of the
different vertical TEC evaluations.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The ionospheric delay corrections have subsequently been applied to
a set of GPS common-view synchronization results between two Italian
timing centers, the IEN and the Astronomical Observatory in Cagliari,
located near two stations of the geodetic system, and the results obtained
are reported in this paper.

We characterize the changes in the GPS ephemeris and clock state's
errors over the period when the system ephemeris Q's were changed.
During the first three months of 1997 the Q's were changed in the GPS
OCS Kalman filter on each of the satellites on specific dates, in an attempt
to better reflect the reality of the ephemeris errors. We report on the
accuracy, stability, and periodic variations of the GPS Kalman Filter's
estimates of satellite clocks and ephemerides. We determine the dates for
the changes in each satellite without prior knowledge of changes introduced
by 2SOPS. We correlate the dates we find this way with dates for changes
in the ephemeris Q's which have been entered. We quantify how some
ephemeris error effects in the GPS improved. We also report on the quality
of the SV clock estimates.

ABSTRACT

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
We have conducted a number of time-transfer experiments using the phase 
of the GPS carrier (rather than the code as is done in current GPS-based 
time-transfer systems). We used data from geodetic-quality "off-the-shelf" 
dual-frequency GPS receivers. The data were analyzed using the GIPSY software 
developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory combined with precise satellite 
orbits determined by the IGS global tracking network.  The radial accuracy 
of these orbits is about 10 cm. Instead of computing the difference between 
the GPS observables as is common in high-accuracy geodetic GPS analyses, 
GIPSY explicitly estimates the receiver and satellite clocks at each data 
epoch. The technical GPS issues we investigated include the importance of 
carrier phase ambiguity resolution, troposphere modeling, and multi-path noise.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The first series of experiments used two independent receivers whose
antennas were separated by about 40 m. The time-differences between the
clocks connected to the receivers were estimated using carrier-phase
methods, and these results were compared with the time-differences
between the two clocks measured using the NIST time-scale system. We 
find agreement between the two methods to substantially better than 1 ns,
but there are also discrepancies which we will describe but which we do
not fully understand.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The second class of experiments used receivers 2400 km apart. We
compared the time-differences measured by the carrier-phase method with
independent estimates of the performance of the two clocks. These
estimates combined conventional code-based GPS measurements with
"three-corner-hat" comparisons with other clocks at the same location.

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br2">
GPS and recently also GLONASS receivers are widely used for navigation. When 
these receivers are used for time and frequency transfer, suddenly all the 
internal delays and their associated stability become very important. For 
accurate navigation they are in `common mode' and only need to be constant 
during an integration period of less than about one minute. This nanosecond 
level problem is sometimes not understood by manufacturers and users of those 
GPS and GLONASS timing receivers that were converted from navigation receivers.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
In the paper this problem is addressed and also the specific GLONASS problem 
caused by the Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) used instead of Code 
Division Multiplexing (CDM) used in GPS. The measurement results available 
will be presented. The calibration and characterization of these delays is 
important for the international atomic time scale.

time of the signals through the systems involved. For TWSTFT the stability 
of the delays encountered in the earth station by the transmission of the 
local 1 pps signal as well as that of the received remote 1 pps signal 
determine the uncertainty at sub-nanosecond level for such transfers.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The characteristics of the TWSTFT earth station at VSL based on data
accumulated with its new automated delay measurement system during
about one year will be presented and discussed in more detail.

ABSTRACT</center> </strong>
<br>
In the development of a new time dissemination capability for the U.S.
Air Force's Eastern Test Range, the satcom channels to be used became an
issue in terms of performance over different links and available coverage.
A primary advantage of C band is that satellite coverage is more widely
available in remote areas where Ku coverage is limited or not available at
all. To investigate the performance issue, a Two Way Satellite Time 
Transfer (TWSTT) cooperative experiment was performed to obtain
comparative data over both C and Ku band simultaneously. Time transfers
were performed over both links to compare a co-located common clock in
a controlled experiment. The objective of the experiment would then
empirically determine the relative accuracies of TWTT over the frequency
bands.
<br><br>
Time transfers were cooperatively performed between a station located
at Rockledge, Florida with the NIST facility at Ft. Collins, Colorado for a
period of approximately ten days. GPS receivers were used in common
view mode referenced to the common clock as an independent comparative
measure. Tests were conducted over a wide range of temperature and
weather conditions. Observations were obtained during snow, heavy rain
and sun with temperatures from 8-90 degrees Fahrenheit at the two
stations. Analysis of the resultant data shows that transfer over the two
links performed about equally with residual RMS results of approximately
5 nanoseconds.

Common View GPS has proven to be an accurate and reliable time transfer

The advent of multichannel timing receivers promises enhanced coverage and

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br>
Multichannel GPS (MGPS) receivers, which calculate a position and
time solution using signals from eight or more GPS satellites
simultaneously, are now available from a number of manufacturers at very
reasonable cost. MGPS receivers are an attractive solution for high
accuracy inter-laboratory frequency transfer where the cost of the more
conventional GPS common-view (GPS-CV) receiver is not warranted.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
We compare the time and frequency transfer performance of MGPS
receivers with that of GPS-CV receivers over distances of up to 6000 km
in the Asia-Pacific region.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
GPD-CV and MGPS receivers were co-located at four sites: Sydney,
Australia (NML); Manila, the Philippines (ITDI); Canberra, Australia
(Orroral) and Lower Hutt, New Zealand (MSL). Timing data from the
MGPS receivers were recorded with respect to local standards at 1 minute
intervals. The GPS-CV receivers were programmed with the BIPM
schedule for the particular location. The data for the international links
cover periods of up to three months.

ABSTRACT</center></strong>
<br wp="br2">
At the present time the international timing community is concerned
with the availability of multichannel GPS and GLONASS time receivers.
This new generation of time receivers offers a great potential that time
users and timing labs can benefit from. One advantage is the continuous
monitoring of the satellite clocks with the possibility for each
implementation of an international tracking schedule. Thus, post processing
is in the users' hands, i.e.; there can be chosen a standard mask angle for
"Common View" comparison. Otherwise the user can perform a study by
varying the processing parameters. If one uses high rate data at one second
sample rate, investigations can be done in much more detail. This also
leads into application of carrier phase measurements if the receiver is
capable of such recordings.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
In this paper we present the first results of "Common View" clock
synchronization between DLR and BIPM using AOA TTR-4P time
receivers with BIPM format output. Code phase measurements have been
analyzed and compared to data from one channel receivers. Both results
have been compared in view of precision and availability of
synchronization data. Recommendations will be given for application of
multichannel receivers for clock synchronization. It will be concluded 
that such receivers will have a large impact for future clock synchronization,
and far more investigation work is required.

ABSTRACT</center></strong>
<br wp="br2">
For the past fifteen years international time transfer used for the
computation of TAI has been carried out using one-channel C/A-code GPS
receivers and an international common-view schedule of standard 13-minute 
tracks. For regional time comparisons, within 1000 km, about 30
tracks are usually available, and for intercontinental distances about 10. 
At present, the estimated uncertainty for operational GPS atomic clock
comparisons is several nanoseconds for a single common-view observation
and a few nanoseconds for a daily average. This performance is barely
sufficient for the comparison of current atomic clocks and needs to be
improved rapidly to meet the challenge of clocks now being designed.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The multi-channel receivers considered here observe all GPS and
GLONASS satellites in view and use standard 13-minute tracks at the
standard hours. At present, the standard hours are defined every six months
by BIPM international common-view tracking schedules.  In the future a
fixed reference date adopted by convention would set standard hours
forever.  Although theoretically up to 12 GPS or GLONASS satellites can
be observed simultaneously, in practice an average of five satellites is 
observed for each system.  As there are 89 useful 16 minute periods in a
day, this many tracks may be observed in each channel.  Using all five
channels, we may therefore observe 445 tracks per day for each of the two
systems. All of these tracks can be used for regional common-view links.
For very large baselines, between continents, 80 to 100 common-view
tracks are available. The increase by a factor of ten of the number of
common views for each of two systems in ``all-in-view'' approach allows
to expect a consequent improvement in the uncertainty of time transfer. Of
course these observations are subject to systematic variations, mainly
caused by environmental effects on the receivers, a matter which has yet
to be resolved.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
This paper provides uncertainty budgets an analysis of the first results
for multi-channel double-system GPS/GLONASS continental and
intercontinental time transfers, including solutions for repeating biases.

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br2">
For regular use in TAI computation, GPS time transfer is currently
carried out with single channel C/A code receivers operating in a scheduled
mode. This is to be changed in the future to overcome the limitations in
time transfer uncertainty and the problems of aging of the present set-up.
This paper studies the use of multi-channel dual-frequency GPS time
receivers to perform time transfer, using all in view measurements to
reconstruct all possible Common-view observations for all baselines.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
We have used AOA TTR-4P receivers operating at the BIPM, the NPL
and the USNO to construct standard Common-view observations of all
available satellites and used these data to compute the time differences for
the three baselines, using precise ephemerides from the IGS and either
measured or modeled ionospheric delays. We compare the results with
classical GPS time transfer obtained with one-channel receivers attached
to the same clocks, and with the results of carrier-phase measurements 
when available. We assess the uncertainty of the realized time transfer
links, depending upon the baseline length and the treatment of the
ionosphere, and compare the uncertainty values with those obtained from
other methods.

ABSTRACT</center></strong>
<br wp="br2">
In the UK there is considerable interest in the possibility of using GPS
Disciplined Oscillators (GPSDOs) as standards traceable to UTC(NPL).
However, UK accreditation bodies are somewhat reluctant to accept
GPSDOs as traceable standards, without a detailed study of the practical
issues involved in establishing traceability. NPL has undertaken an
extensive study, examining the performance of 15 GPSDOs loaned by 11
UK suppliers and manufacturers of GPSDOs, to address this traceability
issue.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
In this paper a detailed account is presented of the results obtained
from the NPL study. Extended measurements have been obtained from
both the 1PPS and phase outputs of the GPSDOs, by direct comparison
against the UK national time scale UTC(NPL). The performance
characteristics of the GPSDOs have been examined in depth. These studies
have revealed the occurrence of time and frequency transients and
correlation between the performances of individual GPSDOs. The GPSDOs
have also been examined operating under non-ideal operating conditions,
for example operating with a restricted satellite constellation. During the
study, both the GPS system and local environment were continuously
monitored at NPL using a group of multi-channel GPS receivers. Unusual
changes in the time and frequency outputs of the GPSDOs were then 
correlated directly against the performance of the GPS system or local
environment.  A preliminary set of recommendations on the use of
GPSDOs as standards traceable to UTC(NPL) have been produced; these
are described in depth. The progress made on implementing a mechanism
enabling GPSDOs to be recognized as standards traceable to UTC(NPL)
will be outlined.

<br wp="br2">
ACES, Atomic Clock Ensemble in Space, was first conceptualised to fly and 
evaluate an ensemble of next generation atomic clocks in July 1995, and to 
test the performance of state-of-the-art time-transfer techniques to
a space-based platform.  
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Due to the variety of potential applications in Time and Frequency, the
European Space Agency considering ACES as a candidate externally-mounted 
payload during the early International Space Station (ISS) utilization 
period scheduled for 2003.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
ACES would allow the characterization and intercomparison of the
hydrogen maser, mercury trapped-ion clock and cold caesium atom clock
in space, the mechanisms behind the operation of these atomic clocks being
quite different. The benign microgravity environment should allow
fractional frequency stability and accuracy of 10<sup>-16</sup> to 
10<sup>-17</sup> to be attained.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Two-way satellite time-transfer at microwave frequencies offers an
atmosphere-independent means of determining clock synchronization
between ground and space clocks at the sub-nanosecond level. Further
dramatic system improvements are unlikely. Only optical time-transfer by
laser link (T2L2) can permit clock intercomparison at the 10 picosecond
level with a total accuracy of 30 picoseconds per day, essential to test the
stability of the new space-based atomic clocks.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
We believe that the success of T2L2 relies implicitly on the ability to
monitor accurate time-on the ground. Such a ground-based system might
incorporate an optical atomic clock, such as that derived from the
ytterbium-172 transition where a 10 year lifetime has been inferred as
observed at the National Physical Laboratory. An all-sapphire cryogenic
resonator, with a predicted frequency stability in the sub 
10 <sup>-17</sup> range, would be an ideal flywheel oscillator for the 
ytterbium trapped-ion clock.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
We therefore detail how the next-generation of optical clocks and
optical time-transfer techniques might bring forward a new realm to the
field of global time and frequency dissemination, with 50-fold
improvement.

<br wp="br1">
 The Comit&eacute; Consultatif pour la D&eacute;finition de la
Seconde (CCDS) created in March 1996 a working group on the expression
of uncertainties in primary frequency standards. This paper presents the
main topics included in the 1st report, dated April 1997, of the working
group. This report gives a brief review of the conditions which led to the
creation of the working group and a summary of the discussions which took
place at its 1st meeting held in Neuch&acirc;tel, Switzerland, on March 5,
1997, and also during the following weeks.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>     During the discussions it appears that the main objective of the
working group is a better understanding between laboratories which
evaluate the accuracy of their primary frequency standards and the Bureau
International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) which uses the measurements
provided by these standards for assessing the accuracy of TAI.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>     A very important point is the application to primary frequency
standards of the guidelines expressed in the <em>Guide to the Expression of
Uncertainty in Measurement</em> (ISO, 1993). Most of the <em>ISO Guide</em>
takes the implicit condition that the system under study is stationary and
affected only by white noise. This is obviously not the case for time
measurements which often deliver time series affected by correlated noise
such as random walk of frequency. Nevertheless, at least one component of
type A uncertainty in primary frequency standards seems to be correctly
described through the computation of values of Allan standard deviation
characteristic of the standard stability. It remains that a number of
corrections, each affected by an uncertainty, are applied to measurements
provided by primary frequency standards. It is not yet clear how these
different uncertainty components can be classified into types A and B, and
if they are independent and thus should be added quadratically in the
uncertainty budget.

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br2">
Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract at the end of 1995 by the
U.S. Air Force to upgrade the space lift range infrastructure at Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida and Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California. The entire contract is divided into three functional areas:
Control and Display Segment (CDSEG), Instrumentation Segment
(INSEG), and the Network Segment (NETSEG). The CDSEG will provide
upgrade of workstations and various data processing computer systems in
the launch operation control center. INSEG will upgrade telemetry
receiving instruments, long range and mobile optic instruments, weather
sensors, and space vehicle tracking instruments in both ranges. NETSEG
will implement a new digital transmission network utilizing asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) technology to distribute voice, data, and video
information in support of launch and launch related activities in each range.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The timing subsystem is an integral part of Network Segment
(NETSEG). Under the RSA architecture the timing subsystem provides
precise time-of-day information and stable reference signal to synchronize
computer network systems, radar, telemetry instruments, and
communication transport systems for the three functional segments at each
range. The timing subsystem will consist of three product elements: station
time, range countdown, and generation of time of vehicle first motion
(TVFM). The entire timing subsystem architecture is based on a Global
Positioning System (GPS) technology utilizing standard positioning service 
(SPS) timing receivers. The purpose of this paper is to present the overall
system requirements and system architecture for the three timing product
elements. Furthermore, this paper will also describe the integral
relationship of the timing subsystem with other product items in the
NETSEG.

INTERNET TIMEKEEPING AROUND THE GLOBE

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Timekeeping via the Internet has become a ubiquitous service extending to 
well over 100,000 public servers and clients in many countries of the world. 
In addition, an uncounted number of private servers and clients lurk behind 
the firewalls of many large government and corporate networks. There have 
been several previous studies which have compiled population and accuracy 
statistics using time-dissemination protocols such as the Network Time 
Protocol (NTP) and others. However, only one study considered reaching out 
to all hosts and routers in the global Internet. That study indexed the 
Domain Name System database of almost eight years ago. The newer studies 
used only a small population to evaluate architecture and algorithm 
improvements over the years since then.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Since the present day Internet has experienced an explosion of
numbers, it is no longer acceptable or even possible to discover Internet
hosts and routers by indexing a public directory service. However, it is
possible to discover them for an organized subnetwork such as NTP. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of the NTP server and clients
operating in the global Internet of today. While the search engine used in
the survey could find only a fraction of all NTP outposts on the public
Internet, it did find 182,000 client/server network paths used by 36,000
clients and servers; 1,700 of these acting as servers, and 230 of these
synchronized to UTC via radio, satellite or modem. Uncounted others,
including large numbers of personal workstations operating as broadcast
clients, escaped detection. The survey measured the residual time and
frequency errors of each server and client, as well as the time offsets of
each client relative to its servers. The paper describes the sophisticated
search engine, survey summary results, and conclusions drawn from the
experiment.

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br2">
Navy platforms consist of many systems ranging from navigation and
ship control to tactical analysis, sensors, and weapons. These systems, each
composed possibly of multiple computing elements are inherently time
dependent. In addition, modern surface ships are quickly adding additional
computing elements and communication networks to address emerging
requirements and technology. Vital to making such a distributed system
function in this environment is a stable robust time service.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
A time service for today's surface combatants has several constraints.
First, it must provide the level of synchronization required by the
applications relying on it. Navy applications have quite stringent
performance requirements. In addition, the time service needs to be cost
effective, utilizing existing communication infrastructure and 
Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components were possible. Finally, the time 
service must be scalable and fault tolerant.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The Navy has been investigating various methods for the provision of
a time service on shipboard platforms. Early on, the Navy identified the
Network Time Protocol (NTP) as a technology with potential to meet its
needs. Various studies were conducted to analyze the performance of NTP
on particular computing elements including modification of NTP
parameters to better address Navy requirements. In addition, metrics were
defined to measure aspects of the time service of interest to the Navy.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Navy efforts to date were applied to the High Performance Distributed
Computing (HiPer-D) Program, a joint ARPA/Aegis effort. The HiPer-D 
testbed includes a heterogeneous computing base operating in a distributed
fashion over multiple network technologies to provide actual Aegis Combat
System functionality. To support this testbed, a time synchronization
subnet was defined using both NTP and GPS components. Performance of 
the HiPer-D time synchronization subnet was analyzed based on the
metrics previous defined.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
This paper presents an overview of previous Navy efforts, a discussion
of the metrics identified as applicable to the Navy environment, and a
summary of the HiPer-D time synchronization subnet performance. In
addition, this paper identifies ongoing and future work required to provide
a stable robust time service and to fully support NTP in a shipboard
environment.

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Within the past few years, significant advances have been made in
Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver technology and radio
communication technology. Both GPS and cellular phone handheld devices
have decreased in size, yet increased in capabilities and battery life. In both
the civilian and military communities, GPS is being integrated with many
other systems, for example, precise time keeping instruments, and tightly
integrated GPS and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). This paper analyzes
the many benefits and discusses conceptual issues associated with a tight
integration of GPS with a wireless communication link for both military
and civilian users.

LONG-TERM TIME TRANSFER STABILITY
<br>OF A FIBER OPTIC LINK
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br>Academy of Sciences Prague, Czech Republic

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br2">
To ensure a subnanosecond timing over a distance of several tens of
kilometers as is needed, for instance, in comparing the clocks of the Czech
Time and Frequency Group Standard (CTFGS), an adequate transmission
system should be used. Such a system must provide high group-delay
stability, signal-to-noise ratio, and insensitiveness to the environmental
electromagnetic perturbations. A time transfer link based on fiber optics  
seems to fulfill the above requirements.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Since 1994 fiber optic links have been used to ensure the traceability
of four CTFGS Cesium Beam Clocks. The clocks are located at two
separated laboratories which are mutually interconnected with four fiber
optic links. Each link consists of an optical transmitter (lambda = 1300
nm), a single mode optic fiber of approximately 10 km, and an optical
receiver. Five MHz signals generated by individual clocks are used to
modulate the light to be transmitted from one laboratory to another. The
main part (about 9 km) of the fiber is laid in a cable duct, the depth of
which varies from 2 to 3 m, and a smaller part (800 m) is buried about 
0.5 m underground.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Simultaneous hourly phase-time measurements have been carried out
at both laboratories for more than 3 years. Environmental parameters such
as temperature, air pressure, and humidity at critical points were registered.
These measurements, besides their basic metrological purpose, have
provided unique data to evaluate group delay changes in the links and to
look for the sources of its instability in time intervals of one hour and
longer.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The analysis of the data shows that the dominant variations have a
seasonal character and are closely correlated with the cable duct 
temperature.  These variations have been found to reach a peak-to-peak
value of about 20 ns for a 20 km link with a maximum relative
frequency deviation on the order of 1X10<sup>-15</sup>.  The influence of 
other environmental factors on the transfer parameters of the fiber and on 
the link electronics are shown to be relatively smaller.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
A method has been developed to correct mathematically the thermal
group delay variations in the fiber. The method is based on the temperature
response in the cable duct calculated from the outdoor temperature. After
correcting for all temperature effects, 0.3 ns (one sigma) of residual
variations have been reached.

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br2">
An experiment to transfer time and frequency using 2.488 Gbit/s SDH
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) systems through 175 km optical
fibers has been set up by CRL and NTT. The time of a Cs standard located
in NTT is compared with UTC (CRL) by transmitting the time signals to
each other and by measuring the time difference between the local clock
and the other clocks. This system uses commercial optical fibers and seven
repeaters in the 175 km transmission lines. The same devices to transfer
time and measure the time difference are set at both CRL and NTT, and
time difference data are also exchanged. The system uses the Section
Overhead (SOH) to transfer timing and time signals, and time difference
data.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
The experiment started in November 1996 and the time difference has
been continuously measured over 9 months. We confirmed that the
frequency stability of the time comparison is 1x10<sup>-12 </sup>
in the averaging time region tau greater 100s. This is equal to that of 
the Cs frequency standard (HP5071A) that is used in NTT. We previously 
measured the delay characteristics of another 2,400 km optical fiber 
system that isolated the frequency stability of the frequency standard, 
and confirmed that the time transfer measurement limitation in the optical 
fiber system is better than 1X10<sup>-14</sup> in the averaging time region 
of 1X10<sup>5</sup>s. These results show that 2.488 Gbit/s SDH time transfer 
has the time transfer capability that allows times to be compared to the 
level expected of the Cs frequency standard (HP5071A) in the averaging time 
region of 1000s.  The time comparison results of this experiment agree well 
with the GPS common-view results. While these results do not show the time 
transfer capability in terms of long-term stability since they include the 
time variation between the NTT standard and UTC(CRL), the long-term stability 
in this system is expected to be better than 1 ns.

ABSTRACT</strong></center>
<br wp="br2">
Time based communications is a concept where the synchronous layer
of a communications channel is used as a vehicle for two-way time
transfer. The technology originated in 1995 with prototype hardware
designs for a self-calibrating optical two-way time transfer system. 
Point-to-point systems were built in 1996 and demonstrated synchronization 
error in a laboratory between a master clock and a recovered slave clock 
at the sub-nanosecond level over 10 km distribution distances. Since then, 
the communications payload capability has been added to the optical two-way
system providing a true time based communications channel with two-way
time transfer functionality embedded in a 155 Mbs data channel. In
February 1997, two weeks of testing were performed at Lincoln Labs
(MIT) to collect an extensive data set on the timing and communications
performance of the system. The test objectives included:
<blockquote>
<br>a. Measure system performance with long range (&gt;10 km) cable runs in
a laboratory environment.
<br>
<br>b.Establish timing and communications performance in a laboratory
environment with typical communications hardware in the fiber link.
<br>
<br>c. Characterize system performance using "real-world" (outdoor) links
exhibiting temperature dynamics which change the length of the fiber.
<br>
<br>d. Determine suitability of the system for application in future
communications systems using All-Optical Network (AON) and wave-division 
multiplexing hardware.
</blockquote>
This paper presents the results of the time based communications
testing performed at Lincoln Labs (MIT) using an Optical Two-Way Time
Transfer Communications System. A short explanation of system design
and two-way time transfer implementation in a communications channel
will be followed by a presentation of data sets from the Lincoln Labs
testing. Time transfer measurement data will be presented from tests
conducted in the laboratory as well as tests conducted over long distance,
outdoor links. The laboratory measurements to be presented include two-way 
time transfer results over fiber in a controlled (constant temperature)
environment with typical communications hardware inserted in the link
between clocks. The hardware used for laboratory measurements includes
electro-optic repeaters and erbium doped fiber optic amplifiers.  The
outdoor fiber links (intended to represent real world links) include a 75 km
fiber run with OC-3 repeaters at the midpoint, and 100 km with wave-division 
multiplexing equipment in the link.  
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
Synchronization error measurement data will be presented for each test
configuration.  Two-way delay data will be presented for the real world
links to show the changes in fiber length induced by temperature variations
in the outdoor environment.  In addition, OC-3 bit error rate data will be
presented to demonstrate the communications channel performance while
conducting two-way time transfer.
