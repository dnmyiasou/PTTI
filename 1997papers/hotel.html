PTTI'97 Hotel Notice
</h3></center>

<br>
Unfortunately, this year's PTTI meeting has run into a stumbling 
block.  <b>The Sheraton at Long Beach does have rooms available for 
PTTI attendees from 29 November - 3 December.</b>  However, right on 
the heels of the PTTI meeting, <i>NIKE</i> is holding a meeting at the 
convention center in Long Beach and has booked almost all of the 
available hotel rooms throughout the city (including the Sheraton) 
for the nights of 4-6 December.
<br><br>
For those of you planning to stay the weekend and then flying to 
Boulder, CO, to attend the TWSTT meeting, PTTI was unable to block 
sufficient rooms for those nights due to the lateness in the 
announcement for that meeting.
<br><br>
Never fear, there are other options available.  The <b>Crown Plaza 
Hotel in Redondo Beach </b>has set aside a block of rooms for the 
nights of <b>4-6 December </b>at the government per diem rate of $97. 
You may <b>call for reservations at 310-318-8888 </b>and request a 
room from the PTTI room block.
<br><br>
We do apologize for the inconvenience.
