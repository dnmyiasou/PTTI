<br>333 East Ocean Boulevard 
<br>Long Beach, California 90802

<br>Fax 562-436-9176

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>If reservations are made by telephone, be sure to 
<u>mention PTTI '97 to receive the special sleeping room
rate</u> which is<em> the current government rate tax inclusive
for the Long Beach area</em>.  Check-in time is 1500, and
check-out time is Noon.  <strong>Rooms are held until 1800
(6:00 p.m. PST if not guaranteed for late arrival by a
credit card or one night's deposit)</strong>. The block of
reserved rooms will be released November 21, 1997,  <u>so
register early</u>.  If rooms are available, reservations will be
accepted after that date at the group rate.  The PTTI rate
is available from November 29 through December 7,
1997.  <strong>Cancellation of the room must be made 72
hours prior to the arrival date.  Please see the hotel
reservation card at the back of the program</strong>.  The
hotel and surrounding area offers a wide range of
restaurants and shops.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<center><h3>SPECIAL NOTICE - SLEEPING ROOMS - SPECIAL NOTICE</h3></center>
There is a citywide convention in Long Beach during the time of PTTI'97 and
hotel space is at a premium.  The hotel is doing their best to accomodate
PTTI attendees; however, certain nights are already sold out as more PTTI
attendees than usual want to stay over the weekend following the meeting.
Therefore, the dates of 4-6 December are sold out.  It is suggested that you
make reservations quickly for the nights of 29 November - 3 December.  There
is a possibility that rooms for the sold out nights will become available in
November when another group in the Sheraton will release any unsold rooms set
aside for their meeting.   In checking, most nearby hotels are also full and,
of course, the rate will be much higher.  The hotel is keeping a waiting list
for those PTTI attendees who wish to stay on beyond the end of the meeting.
If you are already a guest of the Sheraton, it may make it easier to get an
extension of your reservation if rooms become available.
