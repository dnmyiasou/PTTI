All papers are due by December 4, 2003. If the paper is not received by the due date, other arrangements must be made with the Editor. Please be advised that if you are unable
to deliver your presentation, your paper cannot be published in the PTTI Proceedings.
<P>
Include the name of the principal author with phone number, complete mailing address, fax number, and e-mail address (if any) so that the Editor can communicate with you about the state of your manuscript. The PTTI Editor is:

<B>Format</B><BR>

Papers may be submitted on diskette or through e-mail as either a pure ASCII,
Microsoft Word, WordPerfect, or LaTeX file.  Hardcopies will no longer be accepted.  Any diagrams
or other illustrations may be embedded in the file (unless it is LaTeX) or
provided as an eps, jpeg, or pdf file or any other format that Microsoft Word can handle.
The Editor has provided pre-formatted samples (that can be edited) for the
following word processors: 

<DL><LI><A HREF="ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/ptti/ptti_win.doc">Microsoft Word</A>
<LI><A HREF="ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/ptti/ptti_wp.wpd">WordPerfect</A>
<LI>LaTeX (<A HREF="ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/ptti/latex_pc.exe">PC</A> or <A HREF="ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/ptti/latex_un.exe">UNIX</A> Version).</DL>
<P>
The Editor may require that authors make editorial changes to these copies and resubmit them, and may reject papers that are not sufficiently in compliance with his requests. He regrets the necessity for this action.
<P>
A previously published paper in <A HREF="ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/ptti/sample_paper.pdf">pdf format</A> and <A HREF="ftp://tycho.usno.navy.mil/pub/ptti/sample_paper.doc">Word format</A> is provided as an example of the presentation style that should be followed. You must have <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep.html">Adobe Acrobat Reader</A> (available free of charge) installed on your system to view the pdf sample.

<P>
The figures, pictures, and tables may be placed either in the body of the paper
(soon after their reference in the text) or at the end of the paper.
At least two should be placed on each page (for the Proceedings only; for oral presentations, there should be only one per page). Figures should be given Arabic numbers in their captions. Captions generally are placed underneath the figures. The Editor will not arrange captions to match figures, nor will he accept a page of captions.
<P>
<b>Use ONLY the following space on a page:</b>  16.5 cm (6.5") wide and 21.5 cm (9.0") high with top and left margins of 2.54 cm (1.0").
<P>
While the average paper is on the order of four pages of text and two or three pages of graphs, pictures and charts, some people are overly verbose. Remember that the Declaration of Independence takes only one page. Very few pages require more than an average of seven or eight pages.

<H3><B>THERE IS A PAGE LIMIT OF 12 PAGES INCLUDING TEXT AND FIGURES. THERE WILL BE A CHARGE OF $100 PER PAGE FOR EACH PAGE ABOVE THE LIMIT.</B></H3>

Also, please: (1) capitalize "Figure" or "Table" when referring to a particular one; (2) remember that the word "data" is plural; and (3) use American English (British spellings will be expunged).

<H3>Oral Presenters</H3>

<UL>
<LI>The 20 minutes allowed for the paper presentation consists of 15 minutes for the paper and 5 minutes for questions and answers and for getting to and from the podium.
<LI>You have only enough time to give a <B>digest</B> of the paper.
Keep your oral presentation crisp and in an overview style (no detailed
derivation of formulas).
<L1>Facilities for PowerPoint computer projections and overhead transparency 
projections will be provided.  <B>NO SLIDES.</B>
If you plan to use PowerPoint, you must e-mail the final version
of your presentation file to Dr. Harold Chadsey by November 25, 2003 (chadsey.harold@usno.navy.mil; fax 202-762-1511; phone
202-762-1450).  In the event this deadline cannot be met,
then you must hand-deliver a 3.5-inch floppy or CD-ROM containing the presentation to Dr. Chadsey at least 36 hours prior to the presentation as long as you bring a set of viewgraphs as backup.
If there are any abnormal special effects or executables in a
presentation, you should include that information in your
e-mail containing the presentation.
Dr. Chadsey will e-mail you confirmation that the presentation has been
received and report any issues that need to be resolved.  No presenter should assume his/her presentation is acceptable until they receive such notice from Dr. Chadsey via e-mail.  
<B> THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS MADE TO THE DUE DATE, SO PLAN EARLY. </B>
<LI>Allow 3 minutes for each viewgraph.
<LI>Viewgraph font size should be no less than 16 points, but 18 is preferred. Seven lines of seven words each, visible from 100 feet will give you a great viewgraph.
<LI>No more than three variables on a graph.
Make sure that graph axes, lines, and titles are clear and distinct.
<LI>Multiple columns of numbers and complicated graphs belong in the paper, not in the presentation.
The viewgraphs presented need not be the same as the ones in the paper. They should be condensed, clarified, and <B>understandable at first glance. DO NOT USE TYPEWRITTEN VIEWGRAPHS; THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE AUDIENCE TO READ!</B>
Preview your viewgraphs on a screen from a distance of 100 feet.
<LI>You are expected to attend the speakers' breakfast to be held on the morning of your
presentation from 7:00 a.m. until 8:00 a.m.  Your session chairman and audiovisual
equipment director will be available to explain the rules of engagement for the
presentations. 
</UL>

<B>Posters</B>
<UL>
<LI>Please note that your poster measurements should be no larger than 4'x8' and push pins will be provided to you. The posters will be put
up on Monday night and will remain up through the close of the poster session on Wednesday evening (December 3, 2003). Please contact
the Poster Session Chair, Dr. Ken Senior (email: ken.senior@nrl.navy.mil; phone: (202) 767-2845) for logistical support.
</UL>
<B>Editor's Note to New Presenters</B>
<UL>
<LI>For your benefit, practice before a critical audience before you present your paper. Listening to a tape of the presentation is also helpful.
<LI>Hold equations and tables of numbers to a minimum. The point is to present the results and not the entire process involved in achieving the results.
<LI>The written paper is the proper place for the exposition of the entire process or for detailed data. Simplify viewgraphs.
</UL>
