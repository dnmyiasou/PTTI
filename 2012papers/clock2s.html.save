<h2> Clock Performance and Performance Measures. </H2>
 <HR> 
The quality of a clock is not dependent upon its error or its  rate.
It is the <I>rate  variations </I> from  interval  to interval (usually the
standard  interval  is  a day) which determine the quality.  If these 
variations are irregular then  the  clock's  behavior  can  only  be
described statistically. 
<IMG SRC="gif/stopw.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
If  the  rate changes systematically, i.e., 
if  it  increases  by  nearly the same amount every day then we talk
about a drift of this clock.  Quartz crystal clocks  and  (much  less 
so) rubidium  vapor  cells  typically  have  such  a  drift.  Cesium
clocks,  unless  there  is  something  wrong with them, or they have
been mis-adjusted, show no drift. 
 <P> 
Regarding the performance of  pocket or  wrist crystal watches,  the
most important disturbance comes from the  temperature variations to
which the watch is exposed.  As a rule of thumb, crystals have a temperature 
coefficient of about 1 part per million.  That amounts to a
rate change of 0.1s per day per degree temperature change.
    
 <P> 
All measurements of clock performance, or clock stability, start with a 
set of regularly executed measurements of the clock correction 
  With these measurements a table is constructed with the time 
of measurement (or the day number in the series), the measurement,
and first and second differences. The table looks like this:

The squares column will be needed in a moment.
We have assumed that we observe a quartz crystal clock which is 
temperature controlled. The units are milliseconds and the rates
are given in ms/day.  In the case of atomic clocks, the unit would
probably be in nanoseconds because of the much greater stability of 
these clocks.   
 <P> 
Our example clock would be a very good crystal clock because the rate 
variations as shown in the 4th column are small.  Nevertheless, the rate
shows a systematic increase of 20ms in 14 days, i.e., the clock has a 
noticeable drift. This drift is also visible as the average second
difference (sum = 20, divide by 14 ---> average drift = 20/14 = 1.43ms/d/d).
 <P> 
  
The widely adopted and by far the most simple measure of clock stability
is the co called <B>Allan Variance</B>, internationally known as <I>two sample
sigma</I>. It is computed as follows:  Form the squares of the second differences,
add them, divide by 2 times the number of terms and form the square root. 
This gives  
  
        86 / 28 = 3.07;  the square root finally gives  1.75ms/day
  
as the measure of stability.  Such stability measures are also often
expressed in relative terms, i.e., as parts per million, etc. 
One finds the translation between these two styles by remembering that
one day has 86400 s. Therefore 1ms rate change per day corresponds with 
<BR>
(1.0E-3) / 8.64E4    =  1.157 
<BR>
 parts in 10 to the eight.
 <P> 
Our test clock, therefore, exhibits a frequency instability of  
2.02 parts in 10 to the eight from day to day (1.157x1.75). 
  
 <P> 
Remember: A <I> clock error</I> is given in units of time (s, ms, ns), whereas
a <I>rate difference </I>is given as a relative number or as ms/day, ns/day, etc.
