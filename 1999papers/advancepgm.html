departure, you will be charged an early departure fee.</B></P>

<B><U><P><a name="trans">Transportation</a></B></U></P>

<U><P>Airlines</P></U>
<B> <P>United Airlines </B>has been chosen as the official carrier for 
<B><U>PTTI '99</B></U> and is pleased to offer the best available airfares 
and schedules that fit your travel needs.</P>

<P>To obtain the best fares or schedule information, please call United's 
Meeting Desk at 1-800-521-4041.   Reservationists are on duty 7 days a week 
from 0700 to Midnight EST.  Please be sure to <B>reference ID number<U> 527ZJ 
</B></U>.  The fares are available from December 4 through December 12, 1999.  
You or your travel agent should call without delay, as seats may be limited.</P>

least 60 days in advance of the contracted travel dates.  This increases the 
discount to 5% plus 5% off the lowest applicable fare or 10% plus 5% off the

<U><P>Rental Car</P></U>
<B><P>Avis</B> has been chosen as the official rent-a-car company for 
<B>PTTI '99</B>.  To receive a reduced rate, call <B>1-800-331-1600</B>

and include unlimited free mileage.</P>

<B><U><P>Transportation from the Airport with Special Recommendations</P></B></U>
<P>There are a number of airports that you can fly into for the meeting--Los 
Angeles International, Ontario, and Orange County (John Wayne Airport).  
<U>It is strongly recommended that you rent a car to travel to the hotel</U> 
as the trip can take up to 75 minutes depending on the time of day.  However, 
if you prefer to use a shuttle, there are shuttle companies--Super Shuttle is 
perhaps the most recognizable one--that provide service to Marriott's Laguna 
Cliffs Resort at Dana Point.  The fare structure is complex.  The first person 
boarding the shuttle pays a higher price, while succeeding passengers pay much 
less.  Please check with the dispatcher or driver for the price before 
boarding.</P>
